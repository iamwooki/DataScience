            "below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r\n",

            "been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r\n",
            "for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r\n",
            "a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r\n",

            "that likewise,â âWell thrown,â said the tailor, âbut after all the stone\r\n",
            "came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r\n",
            "back at all,â and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r\n",

            "you, I shall have to let the tree fall!â The tailor sprang nimbly down,\r\n",

            "down, gave it into the tailorâs hand, and bade him eat. But the little\r\n",

            "There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\r\n",
            "palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\r\n",
            "huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. âPerhaps some\r\n",
            "accident has befallen him,â said the king, and the next day he sent out\r\n",
            "two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\r\n",
            "Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: âScour\r\n",
            "the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\r\n",
            "three.â But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\r\n",
            "From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\r\n",
            "and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\r\n",
            "of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\r\n",
            "many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\r\n",
            "seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\r\n",
            "king, however, would not give his consent, and said: âIt is not safe in\r\n",
            "there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\r\n",
            "and you would never come out again.â The huntsman replied: âLord, I will\r\n",
            "venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.â\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\r\n",
            "not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\r\n",
            "pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\r\n",
            "deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\r\n",
            "the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\r\n",
            "went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\r\n",
            "water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\r\n",
            "was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\r\n",
            "knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\r\n",
            "was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\r\n",
            "in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\r\n",
            "on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\r\n",
            "keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\r\n",
            "forest with safety.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\r\n",
            "courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\r\n",
            "The boy ran thither and said: âGive me my ball out.â âNot till you have\r\n",
            "opened the door for me,â answered the man. âNo,â said the boy, âI will\r\n",
            "not do that; the king has forbidden it,â and ran away. The next day he\r\n",
            "again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: âOpen my door,â\r\n",
            "but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\r\n",
            "and the boy went once more and said: âI cannot open the door even if I\r\n",
            "wished, for I have not the key.â Then the wild man said: âIt lies under\r\n",
            "your motherâs pillow, you can get it there.â The boy, who wanted to have\r\n",
            "his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\r\n",
            "door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\r\n",
            "was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\r\n",
            "away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: âOh,\r\n",
            "wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!â The wild man turned\r\n",
            "back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\r\n",
            "into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\r\n",
            "and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\r\n",
            "and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\r\n",
            "answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\r\n",
            "they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\r\n",
            "much grief reigned in the royal court.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\r\n",
            "down from his shoulder, and said to him: âYou will never see your father\r\n",
            "and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\r\n",
            "and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\r\n",
            "well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\r\n",
            "world.â He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\r\n",
            "next morning the man took him to a well, and said: âBehold, the gold\r\n",
            "well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\r\n",
            "take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\r\n",
            "come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.â The boy placed\r\n",
            "himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\r\n",
            "golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\r\n",
            "As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\r\n",
            "involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\r\n",
            "that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\r\n",
            "off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\r\n",
            "looked at the boy, and said: âWhat has happened to the well?â âNothing\r\n",
            "nothing,â he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\r\n",
            "man might not see it. But he said: âYou have dipped your finger into\r\n",
            "the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\r\n",
            "anything go in.â By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\r\n",
            "watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\r\n",
            "and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\r\n",
            "out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\r\n",
            "what had happened. âYou have let a hair fall into the well,â said he.\r\n",
            "âI will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\r\n",
            "third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\r\n",
            "me.â\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\r\n",
            "however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\r\n",
            "the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\r\n",
            "still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\r\n",
            "straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\r\n",
            "the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\r\n",
            "his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\r\n",
            "terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\r\n",
            "round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\r\n",
            "already knew everything, and said: âTake the handkerchief off.â Then the\r\n",
            "golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\r\n",
            "it was of no use. âYou have not stood the trial and can stay here no\r\n",
            "longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\r\n",
            "But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\r\n",
            "one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\r\n",
            "forest and cry: âIron Hans,â and then I will come and help you. My\r\n",
            "power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\r\n",
            "abundance.â\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "Then the kingâs son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\r\n",
            "paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\r\n",
            "looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\r\n",
            "could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\r\n",
            "would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\r\n",
            "they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\r\n",
            "length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\r\n",
            "and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\r\n",
            "no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\r\n",
            "royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\r\n",
            "kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\r\n",
            "the kingâs notice, and he said: âWhen you come to the royal table you\r\n",
            "must take your hat off.â He answered: âAh, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\r\n",
            "sore place on my head.â Then the king had the cook called before him\r\n",
            "and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\r\n",
            "service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\r\n",
            "had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardenerâs boy.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\r\n",
            "the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\r\n",
            "the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\r\n",
            "might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\r\n",
            "that the rays fell into the bedroom of the kingâs daughter, and up she\r\n",
            "sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\r\n",
            "him: âBoy, bring me a wreath of flowers.â He put his cap on with all\r\n",
            "haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\r\n",
            "was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: âHow\r\n",
            "can you take the kingâs daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\r\n",
            "quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.â âOh,\r\n",
            "no,â replied the boy, âthe wild ones have more scent, and will please\r\n",
            "her better.â When he got into the room, the kingâs daughter said: âTake\r\n",
            "your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.â He again\r\n",
            "said: âI may not, I have a sore head.â She, however, caught at his\r\n",
            "cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\r\n",
            "shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\r\n",
            "held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\r\n",
            "departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\r\n",
            "gardener, and said: âI present them to your children, they can play with\r\n",
            "them.â The following day the kingâs daughter again called to him that he\r\n",
            "was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\r\n",
            "she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\r\n",
            "but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\r\n",
            "ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\r\n",
            "playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the\r\n",
            "same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\r\n",
            "money.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\r\n",
            "together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\r\n",
            "opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\r\n",
            "army. Then said the gardenerâs boy: âI am grown up, and will go to the\r\n",
            "wars also, only give me a horse.â The others laughed, and said: âSeek\r\n",
            "one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\r\n",
            "stable for you.â When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\r\n",
            "led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\r\n",
            "hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\r\n",
            "forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called âIron Hansâ three\r\n",
            "times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\r\n",
            "appeared immediately, and said: âWhat do you desire?â âI want a strong\r\n",
            "steed, for I am going to the wars.â âThat you shall have, and still more\r\n",
            "than you ask for.â Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\r\n",
            "was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\r\n",
            "snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\r\n",
            "them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\r\n",
            "their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\r\n",
            "horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\r\n",
            "soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the kingâs\r\n",
            "men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\r\n",
            "way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\r\n",
            "a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\r\n",
            "began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\r\n",
            "was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\r\n",
            "conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\r\n",
            "Hans. âWhat do you desire?â asked the wild man. âTake back your horse\r\n",
            "and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.â All that he\r\n",
            "asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\r\n",
            "the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\r\n",
            "wished him joy of his victory. âI am not the one who carried away the\r\n",
            "victory,â said he, âbut a strange knight who came to my assistance with\r\n",
            "his soldiers.â The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\r\n",
            "but the king did not know, and said: âHe followed the enemy, and I did\r\n",
            "not see him again.â She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\r\n",
            "he smiled, and said: âHe has just come home on his three-legged horse,\r\n",
            "and the others have been mocking him, and crying: âHere comes our\r\n",
            "hobblety jib back again!â They asked, too: âUnder what hedge have you\r\n",
            "been lying sleeping all the time?â So he said: âI did the best of all,\r\n",
            "and it would have gone badly without me.â And then he was still more\r\n",
            "ridiculed.â\r\n",

            "The king said to his daughter: âI will proclaim a great feast that shall\r\n",

            "unknown man will show himself.â When the feast was announced, the youth\r\n",
            "went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. âWhat do you desire?â\r\n",
            "asked he. âThat I may catch the kingâs daughterâs golden apple.â âIt is\r\n",

            "he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\r\n",
            "angry, and said: âThat is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\r\n",
            "his name.â He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\r\n",

            "ESTHE GOLDEN BIRDA certain king had a beautiful garden and in the garden stood a treewhich bore golden apples. These apples were always counted and aboutthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night oneof them was gone. The king became very angry at this and ordered thegardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set hiseldest son to watch but about twelve oclock he fell asleep and inthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son wasordered to watch and at midnight he too fell asleep and in the morninganother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch butthe gardener at first would not let him for fear some harm should cometo him however at last he consented and the young man laid himselfunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustlingnoise in the air and a bird came flying that was of pure gold and asit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak the gardeners sonjumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harmonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail and then flew away.The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning and all thecouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more thanall the wealth of the kingdom but the king said One feather is of nouse to me I must have the whole bird.Then the gardeners eldest son set out and thought to find the goldenbird very easily and when he had gone but a little way he came to awood and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting so he took hisbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said Do not shoot mefor I will give you good counsel I know what your business is andthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in theevening and when you get there you will see two inns opposite to eachother one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at go not inthere but rest for the night in the other though it may appear to youto be very poor and mean. But the son thought to himself What cansuch a beast as this know about the matter So he shot his arrow atthe fox but he missed it and it set up its tail above its back andran into the wood. Then he went his way and in the evening came tothe village where the two inns were and in one of these were peoplesinging and dancing and feasting but the other looked very dirtyand poor. I should be very silly said he if I went to that shabbyhouse and left this charming place so he went into the smart houseand ate and drank at his ease and forgot the bird and his country too.Time passed on and as the eldest son did not come back and no tidingswere heard of him the second son set out and the same thing happenedto him. He met the fox who gave him the good advice but when he cameto the two inns his eldest brother was standing at the window wherethe merrymaking was and called to him to come in and he could notwithstand the temptation but went in and forgot the golden bird andhis country in the same manner.Time passed on again and the youngest son too wished to set out intothe wide world to seek for the golden bird but his father would notlisten to it for a long while for he was very fond of his son andwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also and prevent hiscoming back. However at last it was agreed he should go for he wouldnot rest at home and as he came to the wood he met the fox and heardthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox and did notattempt his life as his brothers had done so the fox said Sit upon mytail and you will travel faster. So he sat down and the fox began torun and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hairwhistled in the wind.When they came to the village the son followed the foxs counsel andwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there allnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as hewas beginning his journey and said Go straight forward till you cometo a castle before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep andsnoring take no notice of them but go into the castle and pass on andon till you come to a room where the golden bird sits in a wooden cageclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage but do not try to take thebird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one otherwiseyou will repent it. Then the fox stretched out his tail again and theyoung man sat himself down and away they went over stock and stone tilltheir hair whistled in the wind.Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said so the son went inand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage andbelow stood the golden cage and the three golden apples that had beenlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself It will be avery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage sohe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke andthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morningthe court sat to judge him and when all was heard it sentenced him todie unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run asswiftly as the wind and if he did this he was to have the golden birdgiven him for his own.So he set out once more on his journey sighing and in great despairwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him and said You see nowwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I willstill however tell you how to find the golden horse if you will do asI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where thehorse stands in his stall by his side will lie the groom fast asleepand snoring take away the horse quietly but be sure to put the oldleathern saddle upon him and not the golden one that is close by it.Then the son sat down on the foxs tail and away they went over stockand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.All went right and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the goldensaddle. But when the son looked at the horse he thought it a great pityto put the leathern saddle upon it. I will give him the good onesaid he I am sure he deserves it. As he took up the golden saddle thegroom awoke and cried out so loud that all the guards ran in and tookhim prisoner and in the morning he was again brought before the courtto be judged and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed that if hecould bring thither the beautiful princess he should live and have thebird and the horse given him for his own.Then he went his way very sorrowful but the old fox came and said Whydid not you listen to me If you had you would have carried awayboth the bird and the horse yet will I once more give you counsel. Gostraight on and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelveoclock at night the princess goes to the bathinghouse go up to herand give her a kiss and she will let you lead her away but take careyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.Then the fox stretched out his tail and so away they went over stockand stone till their hair whistled again.As they came to the castle all was as the fox had said and at twelveoclock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her thekiss and she agreed to run away with him but begged with many tearsthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refusedbut she wept still more and more and fell at his feet till at lasthe consented but the moment she came to her fathers house the guardsawoke and he was taken prisoner again.Then he was brought before the king and the king said You shall neverhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stopsthe view from my window. Now this hill was so big that the whole worldcould not take it away and when he had worked for seven days and haddone very little the fox came and said. Lie down and go to sleep Iwill work for you. And in the morning he awoke and the hill was goneso he went merrily to the king and told him that now that it wasremoved he must give him the princess.Then the king was obliged to keep his word and away went the young manand the princess and the fox came and said to him We will have allthree the princess the horse and the bird. Ah said the young manthat would be a great thing but how can you contrive itIf you will only listen said the fox it can be done. When you cometo the king and he asks for the beautiful princess you must say Hereshe is Then he will be very joyful and you will mount the goldenhorse that they are to give you and put out your hand to take leave ofthem but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly onto the horse behind you clap your spurs to his side and gallop away asfast as you can.All went right then the fox said When you come to the castle wherethe bird is I will stay with the princess at the door and you willride in and speak to the king and when he sees that it is the righthorse he will bring out the bird but you must sit still and say thatyou want to look at it to see whether it is the true golden bird andwhen you get it into your hand ride away.This too happened as the fox said they carried off the bird theprincess mounted again and they rode on to a great wood. Then the foxcame and said Pray kill me and cut off my head and my feet. But theyoung man refused to do it so the fox said I will at any rate giveyou good counsel beware of two things ransom no one from the gallowsand sit down by the side of no river. Then away he went. Wellthought the young man it is no hard matter to keep that advice.He rode on with the princess till at last he came to the village wherehe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise anduproar and when he asked what was the matter the people said Two menare going to be hanged. As he came nearer he saw that the two men werehis brothers who had turned robbers so he said Cannot they in anyway be saved But the people said No unless he would bestow all hismoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay tothink about the matter but paid what was asked and his brothers weregiven up and went on with him towards their home.And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them it was socool and pleasant that the two brothers said Let us sit down by theside of the river and rest a while to eat and drink. So he saidYes and forgot the foxs counsel and sat down on the side of theriver and while he suspected nothing they came behind and threw himdown the bank and took the princess the horse and the bird and wenthome to the king their master and said. All this have we won by ourlabour. Then there was great rejoicing made but the horse would noteat the bird would not sing and the princess wept.The youngest son fell to the bottom of the rivers bed luckily it wasnearly dry but his bones were almost broken and the bank was so steepthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once moreand scolded him for not following his advice otherwise no evil wouldhave befallen him Yet said he I cannot leave you here so lay holdof my tail and hold fast. Then he pulled him out of the river and saidto him as he got upon the bank Your brothers have set watch to killyou if they find you in the kingdom. So he dressed himself as a poorman and came secretly to the kings court and was scarcely within thedoors when the horse began to eat and the bird to sing and the princessleft off weeping. Then he went to the king and told him all hisbrothers roguery and they were seized and punished and he had theprincess given to him again and after the kings death he was heir tohis kingdom.A long while after he went to walk one day in the wood and the old foxmet him and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him and cutoff his head and feet. And at last he did so and in a moment thefox was changed into a man and turned out to be the brother of theprincess who had been lost a great many many years.HANS IN LUCKSome men are born to good luck all they do or try to do comesrightall that falls to them is so much gainall their geese areswansall their cards are trumpstoss them which way you will theywill always like poor puss alight upon their legs and only move on somuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them asthey think of themselves but what care they for the world what can itknow about the matterOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he hadworked hard for his master. At last he said Master my time is up Imust go home and see my poor mother once more so pray pay me my wagesand let me go. And the master said You have been a faithful and goodservant Hans so your pay shall be handsome. Then he gave him a lumpof silver as big as his head.Hans took out his pockethandkerchief put the piece of silver into itthrew it over his shoulder and jogged off on his road homewards. As hewent lazily on dragging one foot after another a man came in sighttrotting gaily along on a capital horse. Ah said Hans aloud what afine thing it is to ride on horseback There he sits as easy and happyas if he was at home in the chair by his fireside he trips against nostones saves shoeleather and gets on he hardly knows how. Hans didnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all and said Wellfriend why do you go on foot then Ah said he I have this load tocarry to be sure it is silver but it is so heavy that I cant hold upmy head and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly. What do you sayof making an exchange said the horseman. I will give you my horseand you shall give me the silver which will save you a great deal oftrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you. With all myheart said Hans but as you are so kind to me I must tell you onethingyou will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.However the horseman got off took the silver helped Hans up gave himthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other and said Whenyou want to go very fast smack your lips loudly together and cryJipHans was delighted as he sat on the horse drew himself up squared hiselbows turned out his toes cracked his whip and rode merrily off oneminute whistling a merry tune and another singing No care and no sorrow  A fig for the morrow  Well laugh and be merry  Sing neigh down derryAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster so hesmacked his lips and cried Jip Away went the horse full gallop andbefore Hans knew what he was about he was thrown off and lay on hisback by the roadside. His horse would have ran off if a shepherd whowas coming by driving a cow had not stopped it. Hans soon came tohimself and got upon his legs again sadly vexed and said to theshepherd This riding is no joke when a man has the luck to get upona beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would breakhis neck. However Im off now once for all I like your cow now a greatdeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick and hasspoiled my best coat you see in this puddle which by the by smellsnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at ones leisure behind thatcowkeep good company and have milk butter and cheese every dayinto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize Well saidthe shepherd if you are so fond of her I will change my cow for yourhorse I like to do good to my neighbours even though I lose by itmyself. Done said Hans merrily. What a noble heart that good manhas thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse wished Hansand the cow good morning and away he rode.Hans brushed his coat wiped his face and hands rested a while andthen drove off his cow quietly and thought his bargain a very luckyone. If I have only a piece of bread and I certainly shall always beable to get that I can whenever I like eat my butter and cheese withit and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk and whatcan I wish for more When he came to an inn he halted ate up all hisbread and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he hadrested himself he set off again driving his cow towards his mothersvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on till atlast as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more thanan hour to cross he began to be so hot and parched that his tongueclave to the roof of his mouth. I can find a cure for this thoughthe now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst so he tied her to thestump of a tree and held his leathern cap to milk into but not a dropwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow which was to bringhim milk and butter and cheese was all that time utterly dry Hans hadnot thought of looking to that.While he was trying his luck in milking and managing the matter veryclumsily the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome and atlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down and there helay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by driving apig in a wheelbarrow. What is the matter with you my man said thebutcher as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened how hewas dry and wanted to milk his cow but found the cow was dry too. Thenthe butcher gave him a flask of ale saying There drink and refreshyourself your cow will give you no milk dont you see she is an oldbeast good for nothing but the slaughterhouse Alas alas saidHans who would have thought it What a shame to take my horse andgive me only a dry cow If I kill her what will she be good for I hatecowbeef it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig nowlikethat fat gentleman you are driving along at his easeone could dosomething with it it would at any rate make sausages. Well saidthe butcher I dont like to say no when one is asked to do a kindneighbourly thing. To please you I will change and give you my fine fatpig for the cow. Heaven reward you for your kindness and selfdenialsaid Hans as he gave the butcher the cow and taking the pig off thewheelbarrow drove it away holding it by the string that was tied toits leg.So on he jogged and all seemed now to go right with him he had metwith some misfortunes to be sure but he was now well repaid for all.How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had atlast gotThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. Thecountryman stopped to ask what was oclock this led to further chatand Hans told him all his luck how he had so many good bargains andhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman thenbegan to tell his tale and said he was going to take the goose to achristening. Feel said he how heavy it is and yet it is only eightweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon itit has lived so well Youre right said Hans as he weighed it inhis hand but if you talk of fat my pig is no trifle. Meantime thecountryman began to look grave and shook his head. Hark ye said hemy worthy friend you seem a good sort of fellow so I cant help doingyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village Ijust came from the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I wasdreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squires pig. Ifyou have and they catch you it will be a bad job for you. The leastthey will do will be to throw you into the horsepond. Can you swimPoor Hans was sadly frightened. Good man cried he pray get me outof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or bornbut he may have been the squires for aught I can tell you know thiscountry better than I do take my pig and give me the goose. I oughtto have something into the bargain said the countryman give a fatgoose for a pig indeed Tis not everyone would do so much for you asthat. However I will not be hard upon you as you are in trouble. Thenhe took the string in his hand and drove off the pig by a side pathwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. After allthought he that chap is pretty well taken in. I dont care whose pigit is but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. Ihave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roastthen the fat will find me in goosegrease for six months and then thereare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillowand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy mymother will be Talk of a pig indeed Give me a fine fat goose.As he came to the next village he saw a scissorgrinder with his wheelworking and singing Oer hill and oer dale  So happy I roam  Work light and live well  All the world is my home  Then who so blythe so merry as IHans stood looking on for a while and at last said You must be welloff master grinder you seem so happy at your work. Yes said theother mine is a golden trade a good grinder never puts his handinto his pocket without finding money in itbut where did you get thatbeautiful goose I did not buy it I gave a pig for it. And wheredid you get the pig I gave a cow for it. And the cow I gave ahorse for it. And the horse I gave a lump of silver as big as myhead for it. And the silver Oh I worked hard for that seven longyears. You have thriven well in the world hitherto said the grindernow if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your handin it your fortune would be made. Very true but how is that to bemanaged How Why you must turn grinder like myself said the otheryou only want a grindstone the rest will come of itself. Here is onethat is but little the worse for wear I would not ask more than thevalue of your goose for itwill you buy How can you ask saidHans I should be the happiest man in the world if I could have moneywhenever I put my hand in my pocket what could I want more theresthe goose. Now said the grinder as he gave him a common rough stonethat lay by his side this is a most capital stone do but work it wellenough and you can make an old nail cut with it.Hans took the stone and went his way with a light heart his eyessparkled for joy and he said to himself Surely I must have been bornin a lucky hour everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.People are so kind they seem really to think I do them a favour inletting them make me rich and giving me good bargains.Meantime he began to be tired and hungry too for he had given away hislast penny in his joy at getting the cow.At last he could go no farther for the stone tired him sadly and hedragged himself to the side of a river that he might take a drink ofwater and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side onthe bank but as he stooped down to drink he forgot it pushed it alittle and down it rolled plump into the stream.For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water then sprangup and danced for joy and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heavenwith tears in his eyes for its kindness in taking away his only plaguethe ugly heavy stone.How happy am I cried he nobody was ever so lucky as I. Then up hegot with a light heart free from all his troubles and walked on tillhe reached his mothers house and told her how very easy the road togood luck was.JORINDA AND JORINDELThere was once an old castle that stood in the middle of a deep gloomywood and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could takeany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form ofan owl or crept about the country like a cat but at night she alwaysbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundredpaces of her castle he became quite fixed and could not move a steptill she came and set him free which she would not do till he had givenher his word never to come there again but when any pretty maiden camewithin that space she was changed into a bird and the fairy put herinto a cage and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There wereseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle and all withbeautiful birds in them.Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettierthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before and a shepherdlad whose name was Jorindel was very fond of her and they were soonto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood that they might bealone and Jorindel said We must take care that we dont go too nearto the fairys castle. It was a beautiful evening the last rays of thesetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees uponthe green underwood beneath and the turtledoves sang from the tallbirches.Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun Jorindel sat by her side andboth felt sad they knew not why but it seemed as if they were to beparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way and whenthey looked to see which way they should go home they found themselvesat a loss to know what path to take.The sun was setting fast and already half of its circle had sunk behindthe hill Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him and saw through thebushes that they had without knowing it sat down close under the oldwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear turned pale and trembled.Jorinda was just singing The ringdove sang from the willow spray  Welladay Welladay  He mournd for the fate of his darling mate  Welladaywhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason andbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale so that her song endedwith a mournful jug jug. An owl with fiery eyes flew three timesround them and three times screamed Tu whu Tu whu Tu whuJorindel could not move he stood fixed as a stone and could neitherweep nor speak nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite downthe gloomy night came the owl flew into a bush and a moment after theold fairy came forth pale and meagre with staring eyes and a nose andchin that almost met one another.She mumbled something to herself seized the nightingale and went awaywith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gonebutwhat could he do He could not speak he could not move from the spotwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarsevoice Till the prisoner is fast  And her doom is cast  There stay Oh stay  When the charm is around her  And the spell has bound her  Hie away awayOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his kneesbefore the fairy and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda butshe laughed at him and said he should never see her again then shewent her way.He prayed he wept he sorrowed but all in vain. Alas he said whatwill become of me He could not go back to his own home so he went toa strange village and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a timedid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared gobut all in vain he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flowerand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl and he dreamt that heplucked the flower and went with it in his hand into the castle andthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted and that there hefound his Jorinda again.In the morning when he awoke he began to search over hill and dale forthis pretty flower and eight long days he sought for it in vain buton the ninth day early in the morning he found the beautiful purpleflower and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop as big as a costlypearl. Then he plucked the flower and set out and travelled day andnight till he came again to the castle.He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it and yet he did not becomefixed as before but found that he could go quite close up to the door.Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door withthe flower and it sprang open so that he went in through the courtand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to thechamber where the fairy sat with the seven hundred birds singing inthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry andscreamed with rage but she could not come within two yards of him forthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around atthe birds but alas there were many many nightingales and how thenshould he find out which was his Jorinda While he was thinking what todo he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages and was making thebest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her touchedthe cage with the flower and Jorinda stood before him and threw herarms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever as beautiful as whenthey walked together in the wood.Then he touched all the other birds with the flower so that they alltook their old forms again and he took Jorinda home where they weremarried and lived happily together many years and so did a good manyother lads whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairyscages by themselves much longer than they liked.THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANSAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to hima great many years but was now growing old and every day more and moreunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him andbegan to think of putting an end to him but the ass who saw that somemischief was in the wind took himself slyly off and began his journeytowards the great city For there thought he I may turn musician.After he had travelled a little way he spied a dog lying by theroadside and panting as if he were tired. What makes you pant so myfriend said the ass. Alas said the dog my master was going toknock me on the head because I am old and weak and can no longer makemyself useful to him in hunting so I ran away but what can I do toearn my livelihood Hark ye said the ass I am going to the greatcity to turn musician suppose you go with me and try what you cando in the same way The dog said he was willing and they jogged ontogether.They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of theroad and making a most rueful face. Pray my good lady said the asswhats the matter with you You look quite out of spirits Ah mesaid the cat how can one be in good spirits when ones life is indanger Because I am beginning to grow old and had rather lie at myease by the fire than run about the house after the mice my mistresslaid hold of me and was going to drown me and though I have been luckyenough to get away from her I do not know what I am to live upon.Oh said the ass by all means go with us to the great city you area good night singer and may make your fortune as a musician. The catwas pleased with the thought and joined the party.Soon afterwards as they were passing by a farmyard they saw a cockperched upon a gate and screaming out with all his might and main.Bravo said the ass upon my word you make a famous noise pray whatis all this about Why said the cock I was just now saying thatwe should have fine weather for our washingday and yet my mistress andthe cook dont thank me for my pains but threaten to cut off myhead tomorrow and make broth of me for the guests that are comingon Sunday Heaven forbid said the ass come with us MasterChanticleer it will be better at any rate than staying here to haveyour head cut off Besides who knows If we care to sing in tune wemay get up some kind of a concert so come along with us. With all myheart said the cock so they all four went on jollily together.They could not however reach the great city the first day so whennight came on they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laidthemselves down under a great tree and the cat climbed up into thebranches while the cock thinking that the higher he sat the safer heshould be flew up to the very top of the tree and then according tohis custom before he went to sleep looked out on all sides of him tosee that everything was well. In doing this he saw afar off somethingbright and shining and calling to his companions said There must be ahouse no great way off for I see a light. If that be the case saidthe ass we had better change our quarters for our lodging is not thebest in the world Besides added the dog I should not be theworse for a bone or two or a bit of meat. So they walked off togethertowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light and as they drewnear it became larger and brighter till they at last came close to ahouse in which a gang of robbers lived.The ass being the tallest of the company marched up to the window andpeeped in. Well Donkey said Chanticleer what do you see Whatdo I see replied the ass. Why I see a table spread with all kinds ofgood things and robbers sitting round it making merry. That wouldbe a noble lodging for us said the cock. Yes said the ass if wecould only get in so they consulted together how they should contriveto get the robbers out and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placedhimself upright on his hind legs with his forefeet resting against thewindow the dog got upon his back the cat scrambled up to the dogsshoulders and the cock flew up and sat upon the cats head. Whenall was ready a signal was given and they began their music. The assbrayed the dog barked the cat mewed and the cock screamed and thenthey all broke through the window at once and came tumbling intothe room amongst the broken glass with a most hideous clatter Therobbers who had been not a little frightened by the opening concerthad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon themand scampered away as fast as they could.The coast once clear our travellers soon sat down and dispatched whatthe robbers had left with as much eagerness as if they had not expectedto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves theyput out the lights and each once more sought out a restingplace tohis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw inthe yard the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door thecat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes and thecock perched upon a beam on the top of the house and as they were allrather tired with their journey they soon fell asleep.But about midnight when the robbers saw from afar that the lights wereout and that all seemed quiet they began to think that they had been intoo great a hurry to run away and one of them who was bolder thanthe rest went to see what was going on. Finding everything still hemarched into the kitchen and groped about till he found a match inorder to light a candle and then espying the glittering fiery eyes ofthe cat he mistook them for live coals and held the match to them tolight it. But the cat not understanding this joke sprang at his faceand spat and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully and awayhe ran to the back door but there the dog jumped up and bit him in theleg and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him and thecock who had been awakened by the noise crowed with all his might. Atthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades and toldthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house and had spat athim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers how a man with aknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door and stabbed himin the leg how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with aclub and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried outThrow the rascal up here After this the robbers never dared to goback to the house but the musicians were so pleased with their quartersthat they took up their abode there and there they are I dare say atthis very day.OLD SULTANA shepherd had a faithful dog called Sultan who was grown very oldand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wifewere standing together before the house the shepherd said I will shootold Sultan tomorrow morning for he is of no use now. But his wifesaid Pray let the poor faithful creature live he has served us well agreat many years and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest ofhis days. But what can we do with him said the shepherd he has nota tooth in his head and the thieves dont care for him at all tobe sure he has served us but then he did it to earn his livelihoodtomorrow shall be his last day depend upon it.Poor Sultan who was lying close by them heard all that the shepherdand his wife said to one another and was very much frightened to thinktomorrow would be his last day so in the evening he went to his goodfriend the wolf who lived in the wood and told him all his sorrowsand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. Make yourselfeasy said the wolf I will give you some good advice. Your masteryou know goes out every morning very early with his wife into thefield and they take their little child with them and lay it downbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you liedown close by the child and pretend to be watching it and I will comeout of the wood and run away with it you must run after me as fast asyou can and I will let it drop then you may carry it back and theywill think you have saved their child and will be so thankful to youthat they will take care of you as long as you live. The dog liked thisplan very well and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with thechild a little way the shepherd and his wife screamed out but Sultansoon overtook him and carried the poor little thing back to his masterand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head and said OldSultan has saved our child from the wolf and therefore he shall liveand be well taken care of and have plenty to eat. Wife go home andgive him a good dinner and let him have my old cushion to sleep onas long as he lives. So from this time forward Sultan had all that hecould wish for.Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy and said Now mygood fellow you must tell no tales but turn your head the other waywhen I want to taste one of the old shepherds fine fat sheep. Nosaid the Sultan I will be true to my master. However the wolfthought he was in joke and came one night to get a dainty morsel. ButSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do so he laid waitfor him behind the barn door and when the wolf was busy looking out fora good fat sheep he had a stout cudgel laid about his back that combedhis locks for him finely.Then the wolf was very angry and called Sultan an old rogue andswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent theboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. NowSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherds oldthreelegged cat so he took her with him and as the poor thing limpedalong with some trouble she stuck up her tail straight in the air.The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground and when theyespied their enemies coming and saw the cats long tail standingstraight in the air they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan tofight with and every time she limped they thought she was picking upa stone to throw at them so they said they should not like this way offighting and the boar lay down behind a bush and the wolf jumpedup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up and looked about andwondered that no one was there. The boar however had not quite hiddenhimself for his ears stuck out of the bush and when he shook one ofthem a little the cat seeing something move and thinking it was amouse sprang upon it and bit and scratched it so that the boar jumpedup and grunted and ran away roaring out Look up in the tree theresits the one who is to blame. So they looked up and espied the wolfsitting amongst the branches and they called him a cowardly rascaland would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed ofhimself and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEANIn a village dwelt a poor old woman who had gathered together a dishof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth andthat it might burn the quicker she lighted it with a handful of straw.When she was emptying the beans into the pan one dropped without herobserving it and lay on the ground beside a straw and soon afterwardsa burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the strawbegan and said Dear friends from whence do you come here The coalreplied I fortunately sprang out of the fire and if I had not escapedby sheer force my death would have been certainI should have beenburnt to ashes. The bean said I too have escaped with a whole skinbut if the old woman had got me into the pan I should have been madeinto broth without any mercy like my comrades. And would a betterfate have fallen to my lot said the straw. The old woman hasdestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke she seized sixty of them atonce and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.But what are we to do now said the coal.I think answered the bean that as we have so fortunately escapeddeath we should keep together like good companions and lest a newmischance should overtake us here we should go away together andrepair to a foreign country.The proposition pleased the two others and they set out on their waytogether. Soon however they came to a little brook and as there wasno bridge or footplank they did not know how they were to get overit. The straw hit on a good idea and said I will lay myself straightacross and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge. The strawtherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other and the coalwho was of an impetuous disposition tripped quite boldly on to thenewlybuilt bridge. But when she had reached the middle and heard thewater rushing beneath her she was after all afraid and stood stilland ventured no farther. The straw however began to burn broke intwo pieces and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her hissedwhen she got into the water and breathed her last. The bean who hadprudently stayed behind on the shore could not but laugh at the eventwas unable to stop and laughed so heartily that she burst. It wouldhave been all over with her likewise if by good fortune a tailor whowas travelling in search of work had not sat down to rest by the brook.As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and threadand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily but as thetailor used black thread all beans since then have a black seam.BRIAR ROSEA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way offwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen hadplenty of money and plenty of fine clothes to wear and plenty ofgood things to eat and drink and a coach to ride out in every day butthough they had been married many years they had no children and thisgrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walkingby the side of the river at the bottom of the garden she saw a poorlittle fish that had thrown itself out of the water and lay gaspingand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the littlefish and threw it back again into the river and before it swam awayit lifted its head out of the water and said I know what your wish isand it shall be fulfilled in return for your kindness to meyou willsoon have a daughter. What the little fish had foretold soon came topass and the queen had a little girl so very beautiful that the kingcould not cease looking on it for joy and said he would hold a greatfeast and make merry and show the child to all the land. So he askedhis kinsmen and nobles and friends and neighbours. But the queensaid I will have the fairies also that they might be kind and goodto our little daughter. Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdombut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eatout of they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.So twelve fairies came each with a high red cap on her head and redshoes with high heels on her feet and a long white wand in her handand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave alltheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness anotherbeauty another riches and so on till she had all that was good in theworld.Just as eleven of them had done blessing her a great noise was heard inthe courtyard and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy wascome with a black cap on her head and black shoes on her feet and abroomstick in her hand and presently up she came into the dininghall.Now as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry andscolded the king and queen very much and set to work to take herrevenge. So she cried out The kings daughter shall in her fifteenthyear be wounded by a spindle and fall down dead. Then the twelfth ofthe friendly fairies who had not yet given her gift came forward andsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled but that she could soften itsmischief so her gift was that the kings daughter when the spindlewounded her should not really die but should only fall asleep for ahundred years.However the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether fromthe threatened evil so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdomshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first elevenfairies were in the meantime fulfilled for the princess was sobeautiful and well behaved and good and wise that everyone who knewher loved her.It happened that on the very day she was fifteen years old the kingand queen were not at home and she was left alone in the palace. So sheroved about by herself and looked at all the rooms and chambers tillat last she came to an old tower to which there was a narrow staircaseending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key and whenshe turned it the door sprang open and there sat an old lady spinningaway very busily. Why how now good mother said the princess whatare you doing there Spinning said the old lady and nodded herhead humming a tune while buzz went the wheel. How prettily thatlittle thing turns round said the princess and took the spindleand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it before thefairys prophecy was fulfilled the spindle wounded her and she felldown lifeless on the ground.However she was not dead but had only fallen into a deep sleep andthe king and the queen who had just come home and all their courtfell asleep too and the horses slept in the stables and the dogs inthe court the pigeons on the housetop and the very flies slept uponthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing and went tosleep the jack stopped and the spit that was turning about with agoose upon it for the kings dinner stood still and the cook who wasat that moment pulling the kitchenboy by the hair to give him a boxon the ear for something he had done amiss let him go and both fellasleep the butler who was slyly tasting the ale fell asleep with thejug at his lips and thus everything stood still and slept soundly.A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace and every year itbecame higher and thicker till at last the old palace was surroundedand hidden so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. Butthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping BriarRose for so the kings daughter was called so that from time totime several kings sons came and tried to break through the thicketinto the palace. This however none of them could ever do for thethorns and bushes laid hold of them as it were with hands and therethey stuck fast and died wretchedly.After many many years there came a kings son into that land and anold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns and how a beautifulpalace stood behind it and how a wonderful princess called Briar Roselay in it asleep with all her court. He told too how he had heardfrom his grandfather that many many princes had come and had tried tobreak through the thicket but that they had all stuck fast in it anddied. Then the young prince said All this shall not frighten me Iwill go and see this Briar Rose. The old man tried to hinder him buthe was bent upon going.Now that very day the hundred years were ended and as the prince cameto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs throughwhich he went with ease and they shut in after him as thick as ever.Then he came at last to the palace and there in the court lay the dogsasleep and the horses were standing in the stables and on the roof satthe pigeons fast asleep with their heads under their wings. And when hecame into the palace the flies were sleeping on the walls the spitwas standing still the butler had the jug of ale at his lips goingto drink a draught the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to beplucked and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand asif she was going to beat the boy.Then he went on still farther and all was so still that he could hearevery breath he drew till at last he came to the old tower and openedthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was and there she layfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that hecould not take his eyes off her so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke and smiledupon him and they went out together and soon the king and queen alsoawoke and all the court and gazed on each other with great wonder.And the horses shook themselves and the dogs jumped up and barked thepigeons took their heads from under their wings and looked about andflew into the fields the flies on the walls buzzed again the fire inthe kitchen blazed up round went the jack and round went the spitwith the goose for the kings dinner upon it the butler finished hisdraught of ale the maid went on plucking the fowl and the cook gavethe boy the box on his ear.And then the prince and Briar Rose were married and the wedding feastwas given and they lived happily together all their lives long.THE DOG AND THE SPARROWA shepherds dog had a master who took no care of him but often let himsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer so hetook to his heels and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.On the road he met a sparrow that said to him Why are you so sadmy friend Because said the dog I am very very hungry and havenothing to eat. If that be all answered the sparrow come with meinto the next town and I will soon find you plenty of food. So on theywent together into the town and as they passed by a butchers shopthe sparrow said to the dog Stand there a little while till I peck youdown a piece of meat. So the sparrow perched upon the shelf and havingfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her shepecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelftill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up and scrambledaway with it into a corner where he soon ate it all up. Well saidthe sparrow you shall have some more if you will so come with me tothe next shop and I will peck you down another steak. When the dog hadeaten this too the sparrow said to him Well my good friend have youhad enough now I have had plenty of meat answered he but I shouldlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it. Come with me thensaid the sparrow and you shall soon have that too. So she took himto a bakers shop and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window tillthey fell down and as the dog still wished for more she took him toanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten thesparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. Yes said he andnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town. So they both wentout upon the high road but as the weather was warm they had not gonefar before the dog said I am very much tiredI should like to take anap. Very well answered the sparrow do so and in the meantimeI will perch upon that bush. So the dog stretched himself out on theroad and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept there came by a carter witha cart drawn by three horses and loaded with two casks of wine. Thesparrow seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way but wouldgo on in the track in which the dog lay so as to drive over him calledout Stop stop Mr Carter or it shall be the worse for you. But thecarter grumbling to himself You make it the worse for me indeedwhat can you do cracked his whip and drove his cart over the poordog so that the wheels crushed him to death. There cried thesparrow thou cruel villain thou hast killed my friend the dog. Nowmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.Do your worst and welcome said the brute what harm can you do meand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart andpecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it and thenall the wine ran out without the carter seeing it. At last he lookedround and saw that the cart was dripping and the cask quite empty.What an unlucky wretch I am cried he. Not wretch enough yet saidthe sparrow as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses andpecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw thishe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow meaning to killher but she flew away and the blow fell upon the poor horses headwith such force that he fell down dead. Unlucky wretch that I amcried he. Not wretch enough yet said the sparrow. And as the carterwent on with the other two horses she again crept under the tilt of thecart and pecked out the bung of the second cask so that all the wineran out. When the carter saw this he again cried out Miserable wretchthat I am But the sparrow answered Not wretch enough yet andperched on the head of the second horse and pecked at him too. Thecarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet but away sheflew and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on thespot. Unlucky wretch that I am said he. Not wretch enough yet saidthe sparrow and perching upon the third horse she began to peck himtoo. The carter was mad with fury and without looking about him orcaring what he was about struck again at the sparrow but killed histhird horse as he done the other two. Alas miserable wretch that Iam cried he. Not wretch enough yet answered the sparrow as she flewaway now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house. Thecarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him and to go homeoverflowing with rage and vexation. Alas said he to his wife whatill luck has befallen memy wine is all spilt and my horses all threedead. Alas husband replied she and a wicked bird has come intothe house and has brought with her all the birds in the world I amsure and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft and are eating itup at such a rate Away ran the husband upstairs and saw thousands ofbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn with the sparrow in themidst of them. Unlucky wretch that I am cried the carter for he sawthat the corn was almost all gone. Not wretch enough yet said thesparrow thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet and away she flew.The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had went downinto his kitchen and was still not sorry for what he had done but sathimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow saton the outside of the window and cried Carter thy cruelty shall costthee thy life With that he jumped up in a rage seized his hatchetand threw it at the sparrow but it missed her and only broke thewindow. The sparrow now hopped in perched upon the windowseat andcried Carter it shall cost thee thy life Then he became mad andblind with rage and struck the windowseat with such force that hecleft it in two and as the sparrow flew from place to place the carterand his wife were so furious that they broke all their furnitureglasses chairs benches the table and at last the walls withouttouching the bird at all. In the end however they caught her and thewife said Shall I kill her at once No cried he that is lettingher off too easily she shall die a much more cruel death I will eather. But the sparrow began to flutter about and stretch out her neckand cried Carter it shall cost thee thy life yet With that hecould wait no longer so he gave his wife the hatchet and cried Wifestrike at the bird and kill her in my hand. And the wife struck butshe missed her aim and hit her husband on the head so that he fell downdead and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSESThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept intwelve beds all in one room and when they went to bed the doors wereshut and locked up but every morning their shoes were found to be quiteworn through as if they had been danced in all night and yet nobodycould find out how it happened or where they had been.Then the king made it known to all the land that if any person coulddiscover the secret and find out where it was that the princessesdanced in the night he should have the one he liked best for hiswife and should be king after his death but whoever tried and did notsucceed after three days and nights should be put to death.A kings son soon came. He was well entertained and in the evening wastaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in theirtwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to danceand in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it the doorof his chamber was left open. But the kings son soon fell asleep andwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all beendancing for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thinghappened the second and third night so the king ordered his head to becut off. After him came several others but they had all the same luckand all lost their lives in the same manner.Now it chanced that an old soldier who had been wounded in battleand could fight no longer passed through the country where this kingreigned and as he was travelling through a wood he met an old womanwho asked him where he was going. I hardly know where I am going orwhat I had better do said the soldier but I think I should like verywell to find out where it is that the princesses dance and then in timeI might be a king. Well said the old dame that is no very hardtask only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of theprincesses will bring to you in the evening and as soon as she leavesyou pretend to be fast asleep.Then she gave him a cloak and said As soon as you put that onyou will become invisible and you will then be able to follow theprincesses wherever they go. When the soldier heard all this goodcounsel he determined to try his luck so he went to the king and saidhe was willing to undertake the task.He was as well received as the others had been and the king orderedfine royal robes to be given him and when the evening came he was ledto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down the eldest ofthe princesses brought him a cup of wine but the soldier threw it allaway secretly taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himselfdown on his bed and in a little while began to snore very loud as ifhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughedheartily and the eldest said This fellow too might have done a wiserthing than lose his life in this way Then they rose up and openedtheir drawers and boxes and took out all their fine clothes anddressed themselves at the glass and skipped about as if they were eagerto begin dancing. But the youngest said I dont know how it is whileyou are so happy I feel very uneasy I am sure some mischance willbefall us. You simpleton said the eldest you are always afraidhave you forgotten how many kings sons have already watched in vainAnd as for this soldier even if I had not given him his sleepingdraught he would have slept soundly enough.When they were all ready they went and looked at the soldier but hesnored on and did not stir hand or foot so they thought they werequite safe and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her handsand the bed sank into the floor and a trapdoor flew open. The soldiersaw them going down through the trapdoor one after another the eldestleading the way and thinking he had no time to lose he jumped up puton the cloak which the old woman had given him and followed thembut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngestprincess and she cried out to her sisters All is not right someonetook hold of my gown. You silly creature said the eldest it isnothing but a nail in the wall. Then down they all went and at thebottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees andthe leaves were all of silver and glittered and sparkled beautifully.The soldier wished to take away some token of the place so he brokeoff a little branch and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then theyoungest daughter said again I am sure all is not rightdid not youhear that noise That never happened before. But the eldest said Itis only our princes who are shouting for joy at our approach.Then they came to another grove of trees where all the leaves were ofgold and afterwards to a third where the leaves were all glitteringdiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each and every time therewas a loud noise which made the youngest sister tremble with fear butthe eldest still said it was only the princes who were crying for joy.So they went on till they came to a great lake and at the side of thelake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in themwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.One of the princesses went into each boat and the soldier stepped intothe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake theprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldiersaid I do not know why it is but though I am rowing with all my mightwe do not get on so fast as usual and I am quite tired the boatseems very heavy today. It is only the heat of the weather said theprincess I feel it very warm too.On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle fromwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landedand went into the castle and each prince danced with his princess andthe soldier who was all the time invisible danced with them too andwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her he drank itall up so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At thistoo the youngest sister was terribly frightened but the eldest alwayssilenced her. They danced on till three oclock in the morning and thenall their shoes were worn out so that they were obliged to leave off.The princes rowed them back again over the lake but this time thesoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess and on theopposite shore they took leave of each other the princesses promisingto come again the next night.When they came to the stairs the soldier ran on before the princessesand laid himself down and as the twelve sisters slowly came up verymuch tired they heard him snoring in his bed so they said Now allis quite safe then they undressed themselves put away their fineclothes pulled off their shoes and went to bed. In the morning thesoldier said nothing about what had happened but determined to see moreof this strange adventure and went again the second and third nightand every thing happened just as before the princesses danced each timetill their shoes were worn to pieces and then returned home. Howeveron the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as atoken of where he had been.As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret he was takenbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup and thetwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he wouldsay. And when the king asked him. Where do my twelve daughters dance atnight he answered With twelve princes in a castle under ground. Andthen he told the king all that had happened and showed him the threebranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the kingcalled for the princesses and asked them whether what the soldier saidwas true and when they saw that they were discovered and that it wasof no use to deny what had happened they confessed it all. And the kingasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife and heanswered I am not very young so I will have the eldest.And theywere married that very day and the soldier was chosen to be the kingsheir.THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFEThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty closeby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long afishing andone day as he sat on the shore with his rod looking at the sparklingwaves and watching his line all on a sudden his float was dragged awaydeep into the water and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.But the fish said Pray let me live I am not a real fish I am anenchanted prince put me in the water again and let me go Oh hosaid the man you need not make so many words about the matter I willhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk so swim away sir as soonas you please Then he put him back into the water and the fish dartedstraight down to the bottom and left a long streak of blood behind himon the wave.When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty he told her howhe had caught a great fish and how it had told him it was an enchantedprince and how on hearing it speak he had let it go again. Did notyou ask it for anything said the wife we live very wretchedly herein this nasty dirty pigsty do go back and tell the fish we want a snuglittle cottage.The fisherman did not much like the business however he went to theseashore and when he came back there the water looked all yellow andgreen. And he stood at the waters edge and said O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeThen the fish came swimming to him and said Well what is her willWhat does your wife want Ah said the fisherman she says that whenI had caught you I ought to have asked you for something before I letyou go she does not like living any longer in the pigsty and wantsa snug little cottage. Go home then said the fish she is in thecottage already So the man went home and saw his wife standing at thedoor of a nice trim little cottage. Come in come in said she isnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had And there was aparlour and a bedchamber and a kitchen and behind the cottage therewas a little garden planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits andthere was a courtyard behind full of ducks and chickens. Ah said thefisherman how happily we shall live now We will try to do so atleast said his wife.Everything went right for a week or two and then Dame Ilsabill saidHusband there is not near room enough for us in this cottage thecourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small I should like tohave a large stone castle to live in go to the fish again and tell himto give us a castle. Wife said the fisherman I dont like to go tohim again for perhaps he will be angry we ought to be easy with thispretty cottage to live in. Nonsense said the wife he will do itvery willingly I know go along and tryThe fisherman went but his heart was very heavy and when he came tothe sea it looked blue and gloomy though it was very calm and he wentclose to the edge of the waves and said O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWell what does she want now said the fish. Ah said the mandolefully my wife wants to live in a stone castle. Go home thensaid the fish she is standing at the gate of it already. So away wentthe fisherman and found his wife standing before the gate of a greatcastle. See said she is not this grand With that they went intothe castle together and found a great many servants there and therooms all richly furnished and full of golden chairs and tables andbehind the castle was a garden and around it was a park half amile long full of sheep and goats and hares and deer and in thecourtyard were stables and cowhouses. Well said the man now wewill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest ofour lives. Perhaps we may said the wife but let us sleep upon itbefore we make up our minds to that. So they went to bed.The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight andshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow and said Get up husbandand bestir yourself for we must be king of all the land. Wife wifesaid the man why should we wish to be the king I will not be king.Then I will said she. But wife said the fisherman how can yoube kingthe fish cannot make you a king Husband said she sayno more about it but go and try I will be king. So the man went awayquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This timethe sea looked a dark grey colour and was overspread with curling wavesand the ridges of foam as he cried out O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWell what would she have now said the fish. Alas said the poorman my wife wants to be king. Go home said the fish she is kingalready.Then the fisherman went home and as he came close to the palace he sawa troop of soldiers and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And whenhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamondswith a golden crown upon her head and on each side of her stood sixfair maidens each a head taller than the other. Well wife said thefisherman are you king Yes said she I am king. And when he hadlooked at her for a long time he said Ah wife what a fine thing itis to be king Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as longas we live. I dont know how that may be said she never is a longtime. I am king it is true but I begin to be tired of that and Ithink I should like to be emperor. Alas wife why should you wish tobe emperor said the fisherman. Husband said she go to the fishI say I will be emperor. Ah wife replied the fisherman the fishcannot make an emperor I am sure and I should not like to ask him forsuch a thing. I am king said Ilsabill and you are my slave so goat onceSo the fisherman was forced to go and he muttered as he went alongThis will come to no good it is too much to ask the fish will betired at last and then we shall be sorry for what we have done. Hesoon came to the seashore and the water was quite black and muddy anda mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about but hewent as near as he could to the waters brink and said O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWhat would she have now said the fish. Ah said the fishermanshe wants to be emperor. Go home said the fish she is emperoralready.So he went home again and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabillsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold with a great crown onher head full two yards high and on each side of her stood her guardsand attendants in a row each one smaller than the other from thetallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. Andbefore her stood princes and dukes and earls and the fisherman wentup to her and said Wife are you emperor Yes said she I amemperor. Ah said the man as he gazed upon her what a fine thingit is to be emperor Husband said she why should we stop at beingemperor I will be pope next. O wife wife said he how can you bepope there is but one pope at a time in Christendom. Husband saidshe I will be pope this very day. But replied the husband thefish cannot make you pope. What nonsense said she if he can makean emperor he can make a pope go and try him.So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was ragingand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves and the ships werein trouble and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In themiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky but towardsthe south all was red as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sightthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened and he trembled so that hisknees knocked together but still he went down near to the shore andsaid O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWhat does she want now said the fish. Ah said the fisherman mywife wants to be pope. Go home said the fish she is pope already.Then the fisherman went home and found Ilsabill sitting on a thronethat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head andaround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each sideof her were two rows of burning lights of all sizes the greatest aslarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world and the least nolarger than a small rushlight. Wife said the fisherman as he lookedat all this greatness are you pope Yes said she I am pope.Well wife replied he it is a grand thing to be pope and nowyou must be easy for you can be nothing greater. I will think aboutthat said the wife. Then they went to bed but Dame Ilsabill could notsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last as shewas dropping asleep morning broke and the sun rose. Ha thought sheas she woke up and looked at it through the window after all I cannotprevent the sun rising. At this thought she was very angry and wakenedher husband and said Husband go to the fish and tell him I mustbe lord of the sun and moon. The fisherman was half asleep but thethought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.Alas wife said he cannot you be easy with being pope Nosaid she I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without myleave. Go to the fish at onceThen the man went shivering with fear and as he was going down tothe shore a dreadful storm arose so that the trees and the very rocksshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds and thelightnings played and the thunders rolled and you might have seen inthe sea great black waves swelling up like mountains with crowns ofwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the seaand cried out as well as he could O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWhat does she want now said the fish. Ah said he she wants tobe lord of the sun and moon. Go home said the fish to your pigstyagain.And there they live to this very day.THE WILLOWWREN AND THE BEAROnce in summertime the bear and the wolf were walking in the forestand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said Brotherwolf what bird is it that sings so well That is the King of birdssaid the wolf before whom we must bow down. In reality the bird wasthe willowwren. IF thats the case said the bear I should verymuch like to see his royal palace come take me thither. That is notdone quite as you seem to think said the wolf you must wait untilthe Queen comes Soon afterwards the Queen arrived with some food inher beak and the lord King came too and they began to feed their youngones. The bear would have liked to go at once but the wolf held himback by the sleeve and said No you must wait until the lord and ladyQueen have gone away again. So they took stock of the hole where thenest lay and trotted away. The bear however could not rest until hehad seen the royal palace and when a short time had passed went to itagain. The King and Queen had just flown out so he peeped in and sawfive or six young ones lying there. Is that the royal palace criedthe bear it is a wretched palace and you are not Kings children youare disreputable children When the young wrens heard that they werefrightfully angry and screamed No that we are not Our parents arehonest people Bear you will have to pay for thatThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy and turned back and went into theirholes. The young willowwrens however continued to cry and scream andwhen their parents again brought food they said We will not so much astouch one flys leg no not if we were dying of hunger until you havesettled whether we are respectable children or not the bear has beenhere and has insulted us Then the old King said Be easy he shallbe punished and he at once flew with the Queen to the bears cave andcalled in Old Growler why have you insulted my children You shallsuffer for itwe will punish you by a bloody war. Thus war wasannounced to the Bear and all fourfooted animals were summoned to takepart in it oxen asses cows deer and every other animal the earthcontained. And the willowwren summoned everything which flew in theair not only birds large and small but midges and hornets bees andflies had to come.When the time came for the war to begin the willowwren sent out spiesto discover who was the enemys commanderinchief. The gnat who wasthe most crafty flew into the forest where the enemy was assembledand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to beannounced. There stood the bear and he called the fox before himand said Fox you are the most cunning of all animals you shall begeneral and lead us. Good said the fox but what signal shall weagree upon No one knew that so the fox said I have a fine longbushy tail which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I liftmy tail up quite high all is going well and you must charge but if Ilet it hang down run away as fast as you can. When the gnat had heardthat she flew away again and revealed everything down to the minutestdetail to the willowwren. When day broke and the battle was to beginall the fourfooted animals came running up with such a noise that theearth trembled. The willowwren with his army also came flying throughthe air with such a humming and whirring and swarming that every onewas uneasy and afraid and on both sides they advanced against eachother. But the willowwren sent down the hornet with orders to settlebeneath the foxs tail and sting with all his might. When the fox feltthe first string he started so that he lifted one leg from pain buthe bore it and still kept his tail high in the air at the secondsting he was forced to put it down for a moment at the third he couldhold out no longer screamed and put his tail between his legs. Whenthe animals saw that they thought all was lost and began to flee eachinto his hole and the birds had won the battle.Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and criedChildren rejoice eat and drink to your hearts content we have wonthe battle But the young wrens said We will not eat yet the bearmust come to the nest and beg for pardon and say that we are honourablechildren before we will do that. Then the willowwren flew to thebears hole and cried Growler you are to come to the nest to mychildren and beg their pardon or else every rib of your body shallbe broken. So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear and beggedtheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied and satdown together and ate and drank and made merry till quite late into thenight.THE FROGPRINCEOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs and wentout to take a walk by herself in a wood and when she came to a coolspring of water that rose in the midst of it she sat herself downto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand which was herfavourite plaything and she was always tossing it up into the air andcatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high thatshe missed catching it as it fell and the ball bounded away and rolledalong upon the ground till at last it fell down into the spring. Theprincess looked into the spring after her ball but it was very deep sodeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewailher loss and said Alas if I could only get my ball again I wouldgive all my fine clothes and jewels and everything that I have in theworld.Whilst she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water and saidPrincess why do you weep so bitterly Alas said she what can youdo for me you nasty frog My golden ball has fallen into the spring.The frog said I want not your pearls and jewels and fine clothesbut if you will love me and let me live with you and eat from offyour golden plate and sleep upon your bed I will bring you your ballagain. What nonsense thought the princess this silly frog istalking He can never even get out of the spring to visit me thoughhe may be able to get my ball for me and therefore I will tell him heshall have what he asks. So she said to the frog Well if you willbring me my ball I will do all you ask. Then the frog put his headdown and dived deep under the water and after a little while he cameup again with the ball in his mouth and threw it on the edge of thespring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball she ran to pickit up and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again that shenever thought of the frog but ran home with it as fast as she could.The frog called after her Stay princess and take me with you as yousaid But she did not stop to hear a word.The next day just as the princess had sat down to dinner she heard astrange noisetap tapplash plashas if something was coming up themarble staircase and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at thedoor and a little voice cried out and said Open the door my princess dear  Open the door to thy true love here  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.Then the princess ran to the door and opened it and there she sawthe frog whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadlyfrightened and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to herseat. The king her father seeing that something had frightened herasked her what was the matter. There is a nasty frog said she atthe door that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning Itold him that he should live with me here thinking that he could neverget out of the spring but there he is at the door and he wants to comein.While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door and said Open the door my princess dear  Open the door to thy true love here  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.Then the king said to the young princess As you have given your wordyou must keep it so go and let him in. She did so and the frog hoppedinto the room and then straight ontap tapplash plashfrom thebottom of the room to the top till he came up close to the table wherethe princess sat. Pray lift me upon chair said he to the princessand let me sit next to you. As soon as she had done this the frogsaid Put your plate nearer to me that I may eat out of it. Thisshe did and when he had eaten as much as he could he said Now I amtired carry me upstairs and put me into your bed. And the princessthough very unwilling took him up in her hand and put him upon thepillow of her own bed where he slept all night long. As soon as it waslight he jumped up hopped downstairs and went out of the house.Now then thought the princess at last he is gone and I shall betroubled with him no more.But she was mistaken for when night came again she heard the sametapping at the door and the frog came once more and said Open the door my princess dear  Open the door to thy true love here  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.And when the princess opened the door the frog came in and slept uponher pillow as before till the morning broke. And the third night he didthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she wasastonished to see instead of the frog a handsome prince gazing on herwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen and standing at the headof her bed.He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy who hadchanged him into a frog and that he had been fated so to abide tillsome princess should take him out of the spring and let him eat fromher plate and sleep upon her bed for three nights. You said theprince have broken his cruel charm and now I have nothing to wish forbut that you should go with me into my fathers kingdom where I willmarry you and love you as long as you live.The young princess you may be sure was not long in saying Yes toall this and as they spoke a gay coach drove up with eight beautifulhorses decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness and behindthe coach rode the princes servant faithful Heinrich who had bewailedthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and sobitterly that his heart had wellnigh burst.They then took leave of the king and got into the coach with eighthorses and all set out full of joy and merriment for the princeskingdom which they reached safely and there they lived happily a greatmany years.CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIPA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse and had said so muchto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her that atlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.But we must make a provision for winter or else we shall sufferfrom hunger said the cat and you little mouse cannot ventureeverywhere or you will be caught in a trap some day. The good advicewas followed and a pot of fat was bought but they did not know whereto put it. At length after much consideration the cat said I know noplace where it will be better stored up than in the church for no onedares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altarand not touch it until we are really in need of it. So the pot wasplaced in safety but it was not long before the cat had a greatyearning for it and said to the mouse I want to tell you somethinglittle mouse my cousin has brought a little son into the world and hasasked me to be godmother he is white with brown spots and I am to holdhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today and you lookafter the house by yourself. Yes yes answered the mouse by allmeans go and if you get anything very good to eat think of me. Ishould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself. All thishowever was untrue the cat had no cousin and had not been asked tobe godmother. She went straight to the church stole to the pot of fatbegan to lick at it and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took awalk upon the roofs of the town looked out for opportunities and thenstretched herself in the sun and licked her lips whenever she thoughtof the pot of fat and not until it was evening did she return home.Well here you are again said the mouse no doubt you have had amerry day. All went off well answered the cat. What name did theygive the child Top off said the cat quite coolly. Top off criedthe mouse that is a very odd and uncommon name is it a usual one inyour family What does that matter said the cat it is no worsethan Crumbstealer as your godchildren are called.Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said tothe mouse You must do me a favour and once more manage the house fora day alone. I am again asked to be godmother and as the child has awhite ring round its neck I cannot refuse. The good mouse consentedbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church and devouredhalf the pot of fat. Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps tooneself said she and was quite satisfied with her days work. Whenshe went home the mouse inquired And what was the child christenedHalfdone answered the cat. Halfdone What are you saying Inever heard the name in my life Ill wager anything it is not in thecalendarThe cats mouth soon began to water for some more licking. All goodthings go in threes said she I am asked to stand godmother again.The child is quite black only it has white paws but with thatexception it has not a single white hair on its whole body this onlyhappens once every few years you will let me go wont you TopoffHalfdone answered the mouse they are such odd names they make mevery thoughtful. You sit at home said the cat in your darkgreyfur coat and long tail and are filled with fancies thats becauseyou do not go out in the daytime. During the cats absence the mousecleaned the house and put it in order but the greedy cat entirelyemptied the pot of fat. When everything is eaten up one has somepeace said she to herself and well filled and fat she did not returnhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given tothe third child. It will not please you more than the others said thecat. He is called Allgone. Allgone cried the mouse that is themost suspicious name of all I have never seen it in print. Allgonewhat can that mean and she shook her head curled herself up and laydown to sleep.From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother butwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be foundoutside the mouse thought of their provision and said Come catwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselvesweshall enjoy that. Yes answered the cat you will enjoy it as muchas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of thewindow. They set out on their way but when they arrived the pot offat certainly was still in its place but it was empty. Alas said themouse now I see what has happened now it comes to light You are a truefriend You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. Firsttop off then halfdone then Will you hold your tongue cried thecat one word more and I will eat you too. Allgone was already onthe poor mouses lips scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprangon her seized her and swallowed her down. Verily that is the way ofthe world.THE GOOSEGIRLThe king of a great land died and left his queen to take care of theironly child. This child was a daughter who was very beautiful and hermother loved her dearly and was very kind to her. And there was a goodfairy too who was fond of the princess and helped her mother to watchover her. When she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived agreat way off and as the time drew near for her to be married shegot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen hermother packed up a great many costly things jewels and gold andsilver trinkets fine dresses and in short everything that became aroyal bride. And she gave her a waitingmaid to ride with her and giveher into the bridegrooms hands and each had a horse for the journey.Now the princesss horse was the fairys gift and it was called Faladaand could speak.When the time came for them to set out the fairy went into herbedchamber and took a little knife and cut off a lock of her hairand gave it to the princess and said Take care of it dear child forit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road. Then they all tooka sorrowful leave of the princess and she put the lock of hair intoher bosom got upon her horse and set off on her journey to herbridegrooms kingdom.One day as they were riding along by a brook the princess began tofeel very thirsty and she said to her maid Pray get down and fetchme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook for I want todrink. Nay said the maid if you are thirsty get off yourself andstoop down by the water and drink I shall not be your waitingmaid anylonger. Then she was so thirsty that she got down and knelt over thelittle brook and drank for she was frightened and dared not bring outher golden cup and she wept and said Alas what will become of meAnd the lock answered her and said Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.But the princess was very gentle and meek so she said nothing to hermaids ill behaviour but got upon her horse again.Then all rode farther on their journey till the day grew so warm andthe sun so scorching that the bride began to feel very thirsty againand at last when they came to a river she forgot her maids rudespeech and said Pray get down and fetch me some water to drink inmy golden cup. But the maid answered her and even spoke more haughtilythan before Drink if you will but I shall not be your waitingmaid.Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse and laydown and held her head over the running stream and cried and saidWhat will become of me And the lock of hair answered her again Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.And as she leaned down to drink the lock of hair fell from her bosomand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she didnot see it but her maid saw it and was very glad for she knew thecharm and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power now thatshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking and wouldhave got upon Falada again the maid said I shall ride upon Faladaand you may have my horse instead so she was forced to give up herhorse and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on hermaids shabby ones.At last as they drew near the end of their journey this treacherousservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what hadhappened. But Falada saw it all and marked it well.Then the waitingmaid got upon Falada and the real bride rode upon theother horse and they went on in this way till at last they came to theroyal court. There was great joy at their coming and the prince flew tomeet them and lifted the maid from her horse thinking she was the onewho was to be his wife and she was led upstairs to the royal chamberbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do so heamused himself by sitting at his kitchen window looking at what wasgoing on and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very prettyand too delicate for a waitingmaid he went up into the royal chamberto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her that was thus leftstanding in the court below. I brought her with me for the sake of hercompany on the road said she pray give the girl some work to dothat she may not be idle. The old king could not for some time thinkof any work for her to do but at last he said I have a lad who takescare of my geese she may go and help him. Now the name of this ladthat the real bride was to help in watching the kings geese wasCurdken.But the false bride said to the prince Dear husband pray do me onepiece of kindness. That I will said the prince. Then tell one ofyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon for itwas very unruly and plagued me sadly on the road but the truth wasshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak andtell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point and thefaithful Falada was killed but when the true princess heard of it shewept and begged the man to nail up Faladas head against a largedark gate of the city through which she had to pass every morningand evening that there she might still see him sometimes. Then theslaughterer said he would do as she wished and cut off the head andnailed it up under the dark gate.Early the next morning as she and Curdken went out through the gateshe said sorrowfully Falada Falada there thou hangestand the head answered Bride bride there thou gangest  Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.Then they went out of the city and drove the geese on. And when shecame to the meadow she sat down upon a bank there and let down herwaving locks of hair which were all of pure silver and when Curdkensaw it glitter in the sun he ran up and would have pulled some of thelocks out but she cried Blow breezes blow  Let Curdkens hat go  Blow breezes blow  Let him after it go  Oer hills dales and rocks  Away be it whirld  Till the silvery locks  Are all combd and curldThen there came a wind so strong that it blew off Curdkens hat andaway it flew over the hills and he was forced to turn and run afterit till by the time he came back she had done combing and curling herhair and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulkyand would not speak to her at all but they watched the geese until itgrew dark in the evening and then drove them homewards.The next morning as they were going through the dark gate the poorgirl looked up at Faladas head and cried Falada Falada there thou hangestand the head answered Bride bride there thou gangest  Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.Then she drove on the geese and sat down again in the meadow and beganto comb out her hair as before and Curdken ran up to her and wanted totake hold of it but she cried out quickly Blow breezes blow  Let Curdkens hat go  Blow breezes blow  Let him after it go  Oer hills dales and rocks  Away be it whirld  Till the silvery locks  Are all combd and curldThen the wind came and blew away his hat and off it flew a great wayover the hills and far away so that he had to run after it and whenhe came back she had bound up her hair again and all was safe. So theywatched the geese till it grew dark.In the evening after they came home Curdken went to the old king andsaid I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese anylonger. Why said the king. Because instead of doing any good shedoes nothing but tease me all day long. Then the king made him tell himwhat had happened. And Curdken said When we go in the morning throughthe dark gate with our flock of geese she cries and talks with the headof a horse that hangs upon the wall and says Falada Falada there thou hangestand the head answers Bride bride there thou gangest  Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadowwhere the geese fed how his hat was blown away and how he was forcedto run after it and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But theold king told the boy to go out again the next day and when morningcame he placed himself behind the dark gate and heard how she spoketo Falada and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field andhid himself in a bush by the meadows side and he soon saw with his owneyes how they drove the flock of geese and how after a little timeshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard hersay Blow breezes blow  Let Curdkens hat go  Blow breezes blow  Let him after it go  Oer hills dales and rocks  Away be it whirld  Till the silvery locks  Are all combd and curldAnd soon came a gale of wind and carried away Curdkens hat and awaywent Curdken after it while the girl went on combing and curling herhair. All this the old king saw so he went home without being seen andwhen the little goosegirl came back in the evening he called her asideand asked her why she did so but she burst into tears and said ThatI must not tell you or any man or I shall lose my life.But the old king begged so hard that she had no peace till she had toldhim all the tale from beginning to end word for word. And it was verylucky for her that she did so for when she had done the king orderedroyal clothes to be put upon her and gazed on her with wonder she wasso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only afalse bride for that she was merely a waitingmaid while the truebride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty andheard how meek and patient she had been and without saying anything tothe false bride the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for allhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top with the false princess on oneside and the true one on the other but nobody knew her again for herbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes and she did not seem at alllike the little goosegirl now that she had her brilliant dress on.When they had eaten and drank and were very merry the old king saidhe would tell them a tale. So he began and told all the story of theprincess as if it was one that he had once heard and he asked thetrue waitingmaid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who wouldbehave thus. Nothing better said this false bride than that sheshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails and thattwo white horses should be put to it and should drag it from street tostreet till she was dead. Thou art she said the old king and asthou has judged thyself so shall it be done to thee. And the youngking was then married to his true wife and they reigned over thekingdom in peace and happiness all their lives and the good fairy cameto see them and restored the faithful Falada to life again.THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTSThe nuts are quite ripe now said Chanticleer to his wife Partletsuppose we go together to the mountains and eat as many as we canbefore the squirrel takes them all away. With all my heart saidPartlet let us go and make a holiday of it together.So they went to the mountains and as it was a lovely day they stayedthere till the evening. Now whether it was that they had eaten so manynuts that they could not walk or whether they were lazy and would notI do not know however they took it into their heads that it did notbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a littlecarriage of nutshells and when it was finished Partlet jumped intoit and sat down and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw herhome. Thats a good joke said Chanticleer no that will never doI had rather by half walk home Ill sit on the box and be coachmanif you like but Ill not draw. While this was passing a duck camequacking up and cried out You thieving vagabonds what business haveyou in my grounds Ill give it you well for your insolence and uponthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was nocoward and returned the ducks blows with his sharp spurs so fiercelythat she soon began to cry out for mercy which was only granted herupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This sheagreed to do and Chanticleer got upon the box and drove crying Nowduck get on as fast as you can. And away they went at a pretty goodpace.After they had travelled along a little way they met a needle and a pinwalking together along the road and the needle cried out Stop stopand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way and suchdirty walking they could not get on at all he told them that he and hisfriend the pin had been at a publichouse a few miles off and had satdrinking till they had forgotten how late it was he begged thereforethat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in theircarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows and notlikely to take up much room told them they might ride but made thempromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in nor totread on Partlets toes.Late at night they arrived at an inn and as it was bad travelling inthe dark and the duck seemed much tired and waddled about a gooddeal from one side to the other they made up their minds to fix theirquarters there but the landlord at first was unwilling and said hishouse was full thinking they might not be very respectable companyhowever they spoke civilly to him and gave him the egg which Partlethad laid by the way and said they would give him the duck who was inthe habit of laying one every day so at last he let them come in andthey bespoke a handsome supper and spent the evening very jollily.Early in the morning before it was quite light and when nobody wasstirring in the inn Chanticleer awakened his wife and fetching theegg they pecked a hole in it ate it up and threw the shells into thefireplace they then went to the pin and needle who were fast asleepand seizing them by the heads stuck one into the landlords easy chairand the other into his handkerchief and having done this they creptaway as softly as possible. However the duck who slept in the openair in the yard heard them coming and jumping into the brook which ranclose by the inn soon swam out of their reach.An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up and took his handkerchiefto wipe his face but the pin ran into him and pricked him then hewalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire but when hestirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes and almost blinded him.Bless me said he all the world seems to have a design against myhead this morning and so saying he threw himself sulkily into hiseasy chair but oh dear the needle ran into him and this time thepain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion andsuspecting the company who had come in the night before he went to lookafter them but they were all off so he swore that he never againwould take in such a troop of vagabonds who ate a great deal paid noreckoning and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBESAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out togetherso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels andharnessed six mice to it and then he and Partlet got into the carriageand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them and said Whereare you going And Chanticleer replied All on our way  A visit to pay  To Mr Korbes the fox today.Then the cat said Take me with you Chanticleer said With all myheart get up behind and be sure you do not fall off. Take care of this handsome coach of mine  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine  Now mice be ready  And wheels run steady  For we are going a visit to pay  To Mr Korbes the fox today.Soon after came up a millstone an egg a duck and a pin andChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go withthem.When they arrived at Mr Korbess house he was not at home so the micedrew the carriage into the coachhouse Chanticleer and Partlet flewupon a beam the cat sat down in the fireplace the duck got intothe washing cistern the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow themillstone laid himself over the house door and the egg rolled himselfup in the towel.When Mr Korbes came home he went to the fireplace to make a fire butthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes so he ran to the kitchen towash himself but there the duck splashed all the water in his face andwhen he tried to wipe himself the egg broke to pieces in the towel allover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry and went without hissupper to bed but when he laid his head on the pillow the pin ran intohis cheek at this he became quite furious and jumping up would haverun out of the house but when he came to the door the millstone felldown on his head and killed him on the spot.. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEFAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountainsto eat nuts and it was settled that all the nuts which they foundshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very largenut but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer and kept it all toherself however it was so big that she could not swallow it and itstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright and cried out toChanticleer Pray run as fast as you can and fetch me some water or Ishall be choked. Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river andsaid River give me some water for Partlet lies in the mountain andwill be choked by a great nut. The river said Run first to the brideand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water. Chanticleer ran tothe bride and said Bride you must give me a silken cord for thenthe river will give me water and the water I will carry to Partlet wholies on the mountain and will be choked by a great nut. But the bridesaid Run first and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willowin the garden. Then Chanticleer ran to the garden and took the garlandfrom the bough where it hung and brought it to the bride and thenthe bride gave him the silken cord and he took the silken cord tothe river and the river gave him water and he carried the water toPartlet but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut and layquite dead and never moved any more.Then Chanticleer was very sorry and cried bitterly and all the beastscame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a littlehearse to carry her to her grave and when it was ready they harnessedthemselves before it and Chanticleer drove them. On the way theymet the fox. Where are you going Chanticleer said he. To bury myPartlet said the other. May I go with you said the fox. Yes butyou must get up behind or my horses will not be able to draw you. Thenthe fox got up behind and presently the wolf the bear the goat andall the beasts of the wood came and climbed upon the hearse.So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. How shall we getover said Chanticleer. Then said a straw I will lay myself acrossand you may pass over upon me. But as the mice were going over thestraw slipped away and fell into the water and the six mice all fell inand were drowned. What was to be done Then a large log of wood cameand said I am big enough I will lay myself across the stream and youshall pass over upon me. So he laid himself down but they managedso clumsily that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by thestream. Then a stone who saw what had happened came up and kindlyoffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the streamand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse andmanaged to get Partlet out of it but the fox and the other mournerswho were sitting behind were too heavy and fell back into the waterand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet and having duga grave for her he laid her in it and made a little hillock over her.Then he sat down by the grave and wept and mourned till at last hedied too and so all were dead.RAPUNZELThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for achild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.These people had a little window at the back of their house from whicha splendid garden could be seen which was full of the most beautifulflowers and herbs. It was however surrounded by a high wall and noone dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress who hadgreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman wasstanding by this window and looking down into the garden when she saw abed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion rapunzel and itlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it she quite pined awayand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed andasked What ails you dear wife Ah she replied if I cant eatsome of the rampion which is in the garden behind our house I shalldie. The man who loved her thought Sooner than let your wife diebring her some of the rampion yourself let it cost what it will.At twilight he clambered down over the wall into the garden of theenchantress hastily clutched a handful of rampion and took it to hiswife. She at once made herself a salad of it and ate it greedily. Ittasted so good to herso very good that the next day she longed for itthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest her husbandmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of eveningtherefore he let himself down again but when he had clambered down thewall he was terribly afraid for he saw the enchantress standing beforehim. How can you dare said she with angry look descend into mygarden and steal my rampion like a thief You shall suffer for itAh answered he let mercy take the place of justice I only madeup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from thewindow and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if shehad not got some to eat. Then the enchantress allowed her anger to besoftened and said to him If the case be as you say I will allowyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will only I make onecondition you must give me the child which your wife will bring intothe world it shall be well treated and I will care for it like amother. The man in his terror consented to everything and when thewoman was brought to bed the enchantress appeared at once gave thechild the name of Rapunzel and took it away with her.Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she wastwelve years old the enchantress shut her into a tower which lay ina forest and had neither stairs nor door but quite at the top was alittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in she placed herselfbeneath it and cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.Rapunzel had magnificent long hair fine as spun gold and when sheheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresseswound them round one of the hooks of the window above and then the hairfell twenty ells down and the enchantress climbed up by it.After a year or two it came to pass that the kings son rode throughthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song which was socharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel who in hersolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The kingsson wanted to climb up to her and looked for the door of the towerbut none was to be found. He rode home but the singing had so deeplytouched his heart that every day he went out into the forest andlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree he sawthat an enchantress came there and he heard how she cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair and the enchantressclimbed up to her. If that is the ladder by which one mounts I toowill try my fortune said he and the next day when it began to growdark he went to the tower and cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.Immediately the hair fell down and the kings son climbed up.At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyeshad never yet beheld came to her but the kings son began to talk toher quite like a friend and told her that his heart had been so stirredthat it had let him have no rest and he had been forced to see her.Then Rapunzel lost her fear and when he asked her if she would takehim for her husband and she saw that he was young and handsome shethought He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does and she saidyes and laid her hand in his. She said I will willingly go away withyou but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silkevery time that you come and I will weave a ladder with it and whenthat is ready I will descend and you will take me on your horse. Theyagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening for theold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this untilonce Rapunzel said to her Tell me Dame Gothel how it happens thatyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young kings sonheis with me in a moment. Ah you wicked child cried the enchantress.What do I hear you say I thought I had separated you from allthe world and yet you have deceived me In her anger she clutchedRapunzels beautiful tresses wrapped them twice round her left handseized a pair of scissors with the right and snip snap they were cutoff and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitilessthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in greatgrief and misery.On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel however the enchantressfastened the braids of hair which she had cut off to the hook of thewindow and when the kings son came and cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.she let the hair down. The kings son ascended but instead of findinghis dearest Rapunzel he found the enchantress who gazed at him withwicked and venomous looks. Aha she cried mockingly you would fetchyour dearest but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nestthe cat has got it and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel islost to you you will never see her again. The kings son was besidehimself with pain and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. Heescaped with his life but the thorns into which he fell pierced hiseyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest ate nothing butroots and berries and did naught but lament and weep over the loss ofhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years and atlength came to the desert where Rapunzel with the twins to which shehad given birth a boy and a girl lived in wretchedness. He heard avoice and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it andwhen he approached Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Twoof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again and he couldsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he wasjoyfully received and they lived for a long time afterwards happy andcontented.FUNDEVOGELThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt and ashe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child werethere. He followed the sound and at last came to a high tree and atthe top of this a little child was sitting for the mother had fallenasleep under the tree with the child and a bird of prey had seen it inher arms had flown down snatched it away and set it on the high tree.The forester climbed up brought the child down and thought to himselfYou will take him home with you and bring him up with your Lina. Hetook it home therefore and the two children grew up together. And theone which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel because a birdhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly thatwhen they did not see each other they were sad.Now the forester had an old cook who one evening took two pails andbegan to fetch water and did not go once only but many times outto the spring. Lina saw this and said Listen old Sanna why are youfetching so much water If you will never repeat it to anyone I willtell you why. So Lina said no she would never repeat it to anyoneand then the cook said Early tomorrow morning when the foresteris out hunting I will heat the water and when it is boiling in thekettle I will throw in Fundevogel and will boil him in it.Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting and when hewas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to FundevogelIf you will never leave me I too will never leave you. Fundevogelsaid Neither now nor ever will I leave you. Then said Lina Thenwill I tell you. Last night old Sanna carried so many buckets of waterinto the house that I asked her why she was doing that and she saidthat if I would promise not to tell anyone and she said that earlytomorrow morning when father was out hunting she would set the kettlefull of water throw you into it and boil you but we will get upquickly dress ourselves and go away together.The two children therefore got up dressed themselves quickly and wentaway. When the water in the kettle was boiling the cook went into thebedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came inand went to the beds both the children were gone. Then she was terriblyalarmed and she said to herself What shall I say now when theforester comes home and sees that the children are gone They must befollowed instantly to get them back again.Then the cook sent three servants after them who were to run andovertake the children. The children however were sitting outside theforest and when they saw from afar the three servants running Linasaid to Fundevogel Never leave me and I will never leave you.Fundevogel said Neither now nor ever. Then said Lina Do you becomea rosetree and I the rose upon it. When the three servants came tothe forest nothing was there but a rosetree and one rose on it butthe children were nowhere. Then said they There is nothing to be donehere and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothingin the forest but a little rosebush with one rose on it. Then theold cook scolded and said You simpletons you should have cut therosebush in two and have broken off the rose and brought it home withyou go and do it at once. They had therefore to go out and look forthe second time. The children however saw them coming from a distance.Then Lina said Fundevogel never leave me and I will never leaveyou. Fundevogel said Neither now nor ever. Said Lina Then do youbecome a church and Ill be the chandelier in it. So when the threeservants came nothing was there but a church with a chandelier init. They said therefore to each other What can we do here let us gohome. When they got home the cook asked if they had not found themso they said no they had found nothing but a church and there was achandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said You fools whydid you not pull the church to pieces and bring the chandelier homewith you And now the old cook herself got on her legs and went withthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children howeversaw from afar that the three servants were coming and the cook waddlingafter them. Then said Lina Fundevogel never leave me and I willnever leave you. Then said Fundevogel Neither now nor ever.Said Lina Be a fishpond and I will be the duck upon it. The cookhowever came up to them and when she saw the pond she lay down by itand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her seizedher head in its beak and drew her into the water and there the oldwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together and wereheartily delighted and if they have not died they are living still.THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOROne summers morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by thewindow he was in good spirits and sewed with all his might. Then camea peasant woman down the street crying Good jams cheap Good jamscheap This rang pleasantly in the tailors ears he stretched hisdelicate head out of the window and called Come up here dear womanhere you will get rid of your goods. The woman came up the three stepsto the tailor with her heavy basket and he made her unpack all the potsfor him. He inspected each one lifted it up put his nose to it andat length said The jam seems to me to be good so weigh me out fourounces dear woman and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of noconsequence. The woman who had hoped to find a good sale gave himwhat he desired but went away quite angry and grumbling. Now this jamshall be blessed by God cried the little tailor and give me healthand strength so he brought the bread out of the cupboard cut himselfa piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. This wonttaste bitter said he but I will just finish the jacket before Itake a bite. He laid the bread near him sewed on and in his joy madebigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jamrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers and they wereattracted and descended on it in hosts. Hi who invited you said thelittle tailor and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies howeverwho understood no German would not be turned away but came backagain in everincreasing companies. The little tailor at last lost allpatience and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his worktableand saying Wait and I will give it to you struck it mercilessly onthem. When he drew it away and counted there lay before him no fewerthan seven dead and with legs stretched out. Are you a fellow of thatsort said he and could not help admiring his own bravery. The wholetown shall know of this And the little tailor hastened to cut himselfa girdle stitched it and embroidered on it in large letters Seven atone stroke What the town he continued the whole world shall hearof it and his heart wagged with joy like a lambs tail. The tailorput on the girdle and resolved to go forth into the world because hethought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went awayhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he couldtake with him however he found nothing but an old cheese and thathe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird whichhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with thecheese. Now he took to the road boldly and as he was light and nimblehe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain and when he hadreached the highest point of it there sat a powerful giant lookingpeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up spoke to himand said Good day comrade so you are sitting there overlooking thewidespread world I am just on my way thither and want to try my luck.Have you any inclination to go with me The giant looked contemptuouslyat the tailor and said You ragamuffin You miserable creatureOh indeed answered the little tailor and unbuttoned his coat andshowed the giant the girdle there may you read what kind of a man Iam The giant read Seven at one stroke and thought that they hadbeen men whom the tailor had killed and began to feel a little respectfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless he wished to try him first and tooka stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped outof it. Do that likewise said the giant if you have strength. Isthat all said the tailor that is childs play with us and put hishand into his pocket brought out the soft cheese and pressed it untilthe liquid ran out of it. Faith said he that was a little betterwasnt it The giant did not know what to say and could not believe itof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so highthat the eye could scarcely follow it. Now little mite of a man dothat likewise Well thrown said the tailor but after all the stonecame down to earth again I will throw you one which shall never comeback at all and he put his hand into his pocket took out the birdand threw it into the air. The bird delighted with its libertyrose flew away and did not come back. How does that shot please youcomrade asked the tailor. You can certainly throw said the giantbut now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly. Hetook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled onthe ground and said If you are strong enough help me to carry thetree out of the forest. Readily answered the little man take youthe trunk on your shoulders and I will raise up the branches and twigsafter all they are the heaviest. The giant took the trunk on hisshoulder but the tailor seated himself on a branch and the giant whocould not look round had to carry away the whole tree and the littletailor into the bargain he behind was quite merry and happy andwhistled the song Three tailors rode forth from the gate as ifcarrying the tree were childs play. The giant after he had dragged theheavy burden part of the way could go no further and cried Harkyou I shall have to let the tree fall The tailor sprang nimbly downseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it and saidto the giant You are such a great fellow and yet cannot even carrythe treeThey went on together and as they passed a cherrytree the giant laidhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging bent itdown gave it into the tailors hand and bade him eat. But the littletailor was much too weak to hold the tree and when the giant let it goit sprang back again and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.When he had fallen down again without injury the giant said What isthis Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig There is nolack of strength answered the little tailor. Do you think that couldbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow I leapt overthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.Jump as I did if you can do it. The giant made the attempt but hecould not get over the tree and remained hanging in the branches sothat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.The giant said If you are such a valiant fellow come with me into ourcavern and spend the night with us. The little tailor was willing andfollowed him. When they went into the cave other giants were sittingthere by the fire and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand andwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought It is muchmore spacious here than in my workshop. The giant showed him a bed andsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed however was toobig for the little tailor he did not lie down in it but crept intoa corner. When it was midnight and the giant thought that the littletailor was lying in a sound sleep he got up took a great iron barcut through the bed with one blow and thought he had finished off thegrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into theforest and had quite forgotten the little tailor when all at once hewalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrifiedthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead and ran away in agreat hurry.The little tailor went onwards always following his own pointed nose.After he had walked for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royalpalace and as he felt weary he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.Whilst he lay there the people came and inspected him on all sides andread on his girdle Seven at one stroke. Ah said they what doesthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace He must be a mightylord. They went and announced him to the king and gave it as theiropinion that if war should break out this would be a weighty and usefulman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleasedthe king and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offerhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing bythe sleeper waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyesand then conveyed to him this proposal. For this very reason haveI come here the tailor replied I am ready to enter the kingsservice. He was therefore honourably received and a special dwellingwas assigned him.The soldiers however were set against the little tailor and wishedhim a thousand miles away. What is to be the end of this they saidamong themselves. If we quarrel with him and he strikes about himseven of us will fall at every blow not one of us can stand againsthim. They came therefore to a decision betook themselves in a body tothe king and begged for their dismissal. We are not prepared saidthey to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke. The king wassorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servantswished that he had never set eyes on the tailor and would willinglyhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him hisdismissal for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his peopledead and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for along time and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailorand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior he had onerequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giantswho caused great mischief with their robbing murdering ravagingand burning and no one could approach them without putting himself indanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants hewould give him his only daughter to wife and half of his kingdom as adowry likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me thought thelittle tailor. One is not offered a beautiful princess and half akingdom every day of ones life Oh yes he replied I will soonsubdue the giants and do not require the help of the hundred horsemento do it he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid oftwo.The little tailor went forth and the hundred horsemen followed him.When he came to the outskirts of the forest he said to his followersJust stay waiting here I alone will soon finish off the giants. Thenhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After awhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree andsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor notidle gathered two pocketsful of stones and with these climbed up thetree. When he was halfway up he slipped down by a branch until he satjust above the sleepers and then let one stone after another fall onthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothingbut at last he awoke pushed his comrade and said Why are youknocking me You must be dreaming said the other I am not knockingyou. They laid themselves down to sleep again and then the tailorthrew a stone down on the second. What is the meaning of this criedthe other Why are you pelting me I am not pelting you answeredthe first growling. They disputed about it for a time but as they wereweary they let the matter rest and their eyes closed once more. Thelittle tailor began his game again picked out the biggest stone andthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. Thatis too bad cried he and sprang up like a madman and pushed hiscompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back inthe same coin and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees andbelaboured each other so long that at last they both fell down dead onthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. It isa lucky thing said he that they did not tear up the tree on whichI was sitting or I should have had to sprint on to another like asquirrel but we tailors are nimble. He drew out his sword and gaveeach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast and then went out to thehorsemen and said The work is done I have finished both of themoff but it was hard work They tore up trees in their sore need anddefended themselves with them but all that is to no purpose when a manlike myself comes who can kill seven at one blow. But are you notwounded asked the horsemen. You need not concern yourself aboutthat answered the tailor they have not bent one hair of mine. Thehorsemen would not believe him and rode into the forest there theyfound the giants swimming in their blood and all round about lay thetornup trees.The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward he howeverrepented of his promise and again bethought himself how he could getrid of the hero. Before you receive my daughter and the half of mykingdom said he to him you must perform one more heroic deed. Inthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm and you must catchit first. I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at oneblow is my kind of affair. He took a rope and an axe with him wentforth into the forest and again bade those who were sent with him towait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towardshim and rushed directly on the tailor as if it would gore him with itshorn without more ado. Softly softly it cant be done as quickly asthat said he and stood still and waited until the animal was quiteclose and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran againstthe tree with all its strength and stuck its horn so fast in the trunkthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again and thus itwas caught. Now I have got the bird said the tailor and came outfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck and then with hisaxe he hewed the horn out of the tree and when all was ready he led thebeast away and took it to the king.The king still would not give him the promised reward and made a thirddemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar thatmade great havoc in the forest and the huntsmen should give him theirhelp. Willingly said the tailor that is childs play He did nottake the huntsmen with him into the forest and they were well pleasedthat he did not for the wild boar had several times received them insuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. Whenthe boar perceived the tailor it ran on him with foaming mouth andwhetted tusks and was about to throw him to the ground but the herofled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window atonce and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him but the tailorran round outside and shut the door behind it and then the ragingbeast which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the windowwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that theymight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero however went tothe king who was now whether he liked it or not obliged to keep hispromise and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he knownthat it was no warlike hero but a little tailor who was standing beforehim it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The weddingwas held with great magnificence and small joy and out of a tailor aking was made.After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams atnight Boy make me the doublet and patch the pantaloons or else Iwill rap the yardmeasure over your ears. Then she discovered in whatstate of life the young lord had been born and next morning complainedof her wrongs to her father and begged him to help her to get rid ofher husband who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted herand said Leave your bedroom door open this night and my servantsshall stand outside and when he has fallen asleep shall go in bindhim and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wideworld. The woman was satisfied with this but the kings armourbearerwho had heard all was friendly with the young lord and informed him ofthe whole plot. Ill put a screw into that business said the littletailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time andwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep she got up opened the doorand then lay down again. The little tailor who was only pretending tobe asleep began to cry out in a clear voice Boy make me the doubletand patch me the pantaloons or I will rap the yardmeasure over yourears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants I brought away oneunicorn and caught a wild boar and am I to fear those who are standingoutside the room. When these men heard the tailor speaking thus theywere overcome by a great dread and ran as if the wild huntsman werebehind them and none of them would venture anything further againsthim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of hislife.HANSEL AND GRETELHard by a great forest dwelt a poor woodcutter with his wife and histwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He hadlittle to bite and to break and once when great dearth fell on theland he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thoughtover this by night in his bed and tossed about in his anxiety hegroaned and said to his wife What is to become of us How are weto feed our poor children when we no longer have anything even forourselves Ill tell you what husband answered the woman earlytomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to whereit is the thickest there we will light a fire for them and give eachof them one more piece of bread and then we will go to our work andleave them alone. They will not find the way home again and we shall berid of them. No wife said the man I will not do that how can Ibear to leave my children alone in the forestthe wild animals wouldsoon come and tear them to pieces. O you fool said she then wemust all four die of hunger you may as well plane the planks for ourcoffins and she left him no peace until he consented. But I feel verysorry for the poor children all the same said the man.The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger and hadheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel weptbitter tears and said to Hansel Now all is over with us. Be quietGretel said Hansel do not distress yourself I will soon find a wayto help us. And when the old folks had fallen asleep he got up puton his little coat opened the door below and crept outside. The moonshone brightly and the white pebbles which lay in front of the houseglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed thelittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he wentback and said to Gretel Be comforted dear little sister and sleep inpeace God will not forsake us and he lay down again in his bed. Whenday dawned but before the sun had risen the woman came and awoke thetwo children saying Get up you sluggards we are going into theforest to fetch wood. She gave each a little piece of bread and saidThere is something for your dinner but do not eat it up before thenfor you will get nothing else. Gretel took the bread under her apronas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out togetheron the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time Hanselstood still and peeped back at the house and did so again and again.His father said Hansel what are you looking at there and stayingbehind for Pay attention and do not forget how to use your legs. Ahfather said Hansel I am looking at my little white cat which issitting up on the roof and wants to say goodbye to me. The wife saidFool that is not your little cat that is the morning sun which isshining on the chimneys. Hansel however had not been looking back atthe cat but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebblestonesout of his pocket on the road.When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said Nowchildren pile up some wood and I will light a fire that you may notbe cold. Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together as high as alittle hill. The brushwood was lighted and when the flames were burningvery high the woman said Now children lay yourselves down by thefire and rest we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When wehave done we will come back and fetch you away.Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire and when noon came each ate a littlepiece of bread and as they heard the strokes of the woodaxe theybelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe however buta branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind wasblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a longtime their eyes closed with fatigue and they fell fast asleep. Whenat last they awoke it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry andsaid How are we to get out of the forest now But Hansel comfortedher and said Just wait a little until the moon has risen and then wewill soon find the way. And when the full moon had risen Hansel tookhis little sister by the hand and followed the pebbles which shone likenewlycoined silver pieces and showed them the way.They walked the whole night long and by break of day came once moreto their fathers house. They knocked at the door and when the womanopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel she said You naughtychildren why have you slept so long in the forestwe thought you werenever coming back at all The father however rejoiced for it had cuthim to the heart to leave them behind alone.Not long afterwards there was once more great dearth throughout theland and the children heard their mother saying at night to theirfather Everything is eaten again we have one half loaf left and thatis the end. The children must go we will take them farther into thewood so that they will not find their way out again there is no othermeans of saving ourselves The mans heart was heavy and he thoughtIt would be better for you to share the last mouthful with yourchildren. The woman however would listen to nothing that he had tosay but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B likewiseand as he had yielded the first time he had to do so a second timealso.The children however were still awake and had heard the conversation.When the old folks were asleep Hansel again got up and wanted to goout and pick up pebbles as he had done before but the woman had lockedthe door and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted hislittle sister and said Do not cry Gretel go to sleep quietly thegood God will help us.Early in the morning came the woman and took the children out of theirbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them but it was still smallerthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled hisin his pocket and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.Hansel why do you stop and look round said the father go on. Iam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof andwants to say goodbye to me answered Hansel. Fool said the womanthat is not your little pigeon that is the morning sun that is shiningon the chimney. Hansel however little by little threw all the crumbson the path.The woman led the children still deeper into the forest where they hadnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made andthe mother said Just sit there you children and when you are tiredyou may sleep a little we are going into the forest to cut wood and inthe evening when we are done we will come and fetch you away. Whenit was noon Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel who hadscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed butno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was darknight and Hansel comforted his little sister and said Just waitGretel until the moon rises and then we shall see the crumbs of breadwhich I have strewn about they will show us our way home again. Whenthe moon came they set out but they found no crumbs for the manythousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had pickedthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel We shall soon find the way butthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next daytoo from morning till evening but they did not get out of the forestand were very hungry for they had nothing to eat but two or threeberries which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that theirlegs would carry them no longer they lay down beneath a tree and fellasleep.It was now three mornings since they had left their fathers house. Theybegan to walk again but they always came deeper into the forest and ifhelp did not come soon they must die of hunger and weariness. When itwas midday they saw a beautiful snowwhite bird sitting on a boughwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. Andwhen its song was over it spread its wings and flew away before themand they followed it until they reached a little house on the roof ofwhich it alighted and when they approached the little house they sawthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes but that the windowswere of clear sugar. We will set to work on that said Hansel andhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof and you Gretel can eatsome of the window it will taste sweet. Hansel reached up above andbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted and Gretel leantagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice criedfrom the parlour Nibble nibble gnaw  Who is nibbling at my little houseThe children answered The wind the wind  The heavenborn windand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel who liked thetaste of the roof tore down a great piece of it and Gretel pushed outthe whole of one round windowpane sat down and enjoyed herself withit. Suddenly the door opened and a woman as old as the hills whosupported herself on crutches came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel wereso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in theirhands. The old woman however nodded her head and said Oh you dearchildren who has brought you here do come in and stay with me. Noharm shall happen to you. She took them both by the hand and led theminto her little house. Then good food was set before them milk andpancakes with sugar apples and nuts. Afterwards two pretty littlebeds were covered with clean white linen and Hansel and Gretel lay downin them and thought they were in heaven.The old woman had only pretended to be so kind she was in realitya wicked witch who lay in wait for children and had only built thelittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fellinto her power she killed it cooked and ate it and that was a feastday with her. Witches have red eyes and cannot see far but they havea keen scent like the beasts and are aware when human beings draw near.When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood she laughed withmalice and said mockingly I have them they shall not escape meagain Early in the morning before the children were awake she wasalready up and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking sopretty with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself Thatwill be a dainty mouthful Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelledhand carried him into a little stable and locked him in behind agrated door. Scream as he might it would not help him. Then she went toGretel shook her till she awoke and cried Get up lazy thing fetchsome water and cook something good for your brother he is in thestable outside and is to be made fat. When he is fat I will eat him.Gretel began to weep bitterly but it was all in vain for she wasforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel but Gretel got nothingbut crabshells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable andcried Hansel stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soonbe fat. Hansel however stretched out a little bone to her andthe old woman who had dim eyes could not see it and thought it wasHansels finger and was astonished that there was no way of fatteninghim. When four weeks had gone by and Hansel still remained thin shewas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. Now thenGretel she cried to the girl stir yourself and bring some water.Let Hansel be fat or lean tomorrow I will kill him and cook him. Ahhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the waterand how her tears did flow down her cheeks Dear God do help us shecried. If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us we shouldat any rate have died together. Just keep your noise to yourselfsaid the old woman it wont help you at all.Early in the morning Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron withthe water and light the fire. We will bake first said the old womanI have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough. She pushed poorGretel out to the oven from which flames of fire were already darting.Creep in said the witch and see if it is properly heated so thatwe can put the bread in. And once Gretel was inside she intended toshut the oven and let her bake in it and then she would eat her too.But Gretel saw what she had in mind and said I do not know how I amto do it how do I get in Silly goose said the old woman. The dooris big enough just look I can get in myself and she crept up andthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that droveher far into it and shut the iron door and fastened the bolt. Oh thenshe began to howl quite horribly but Gretel ran away and the godlesswitch was miserably burnt to death.Gretel however ran like lightning to Hansel opened his little stableand cried Hansel we are saved The old witch is dead Then Hanselsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they didrejoice and embrace each other and dance about and kiss each other Andas they had no longer any need to fear her they went into the witchshouse and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.These are far better than pebbles said Hansel and thrust into hispockets whatever could be got in and Gretel said I too will takesomething home with me and filled her pinafore full. But now we mustbe off said Hansel that we may get out of the witchs forest.When they had walked for two hours they came to a great stretch ofwater. We cannot cross said Hansel I see no footplank and nobridge. And there is also no ferry answered Gretel but a whiteduck is swimming there if I ask her she will help us over. Then shecried Little duck little duck dost thou see  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee  Theres never a plank or bridge in sight  Take us across on thy back so white.The duck came to them and Hansel seated himself on its back and toldhis sister to sit by him. No replied Gretel that will be too heavyfor the little duck she shall take us across one after the other. Thegood little duck did so and when they were once safely across and hadwalked for a short time the forest seemed to be more and more familiarto them and at length they saw from afar their fathers house. Thenthey began to run rushed into the parlour and threw themselves roundtheir fathers neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he hadleft the children in the forest the woman however was dead. Gretelemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about theroom and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket toadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end and they lived togetherin perfect happiness. My tale is done there runs a mouse whosoevercatches it may make himself a big fur cap out of it.THE MOUSE THE BIRD AND THE SAUSAGEOnce upon a time a mouse a bird and a sausage entered intopartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went wellthey lived in great comfort and prospered so far as to be able to addconsiderably to their stores. The birds duty was to fly daily into thewood and bring in fuel the mouse fetched the water and the sausage sawto the cooking.When people are too well off they always begin to long for somethingnew. And so it came to pass that the bird while out one day met afellow bird to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of hishousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being apoor simpleton who did all the hard work while the other two stayedat home and had a good time of it. For when the mouse had made the fireand fetched in the water she could retire into her little room and restuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch thepot to see that the food was properly cooked and when it was neardinnertime he just threw himself into the broth or rolled in and outamong the vegetables three or four times and there they were butteredand salted and ready to be served. Then when the bird came home andhad laid aside his burden they sat down to table and when they hadfinished their meal they could sleep their fill till the followingmorning and that was really a very delightful life.Influenced by those remarks the bird next morning refused to bring inthe wood telling the others that he had been their servant long enoughand had been a fool into the bargain and that it was now time to make achange and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and prayas the mouse and the sausage might it was of no use the bird remainedmaster of the situation and the venture had to be made. They thereforedrew lots and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood to the mouseto cook and to the bird to fetch the water.And now what happened The sausage started in search of wood the birdmade the fire and the mouse put on the pot and then these two waitedtill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But thesausage remained so long away that they became uneasy and the birdflew out to meet him. He had not flown far however when he came acrossa dog who having met the sausage had regarded him as his legitimatebooty and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dogof this barefaced robbery but nothing he said was of any avail forthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage andthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.He picked up the wood and flew sadly home and told the mouse all hehad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy but agreed to make thebest of things and to remain with one another.So now the bird set the table and the mouse looked after the food andwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage by rolling in andout among the vegetables to salt and butter them she jumped into thepot but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom havingalready parted not only with her skin and hair but also with life.Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner but hecould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry he threw the woodhere and there about the floor called and searched but no cook was tobe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown downcaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some waterbut his pail fell into the well and he after it and as he was unableto recover himself he was drowned.MOTHER HOLLEOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters one of themwas beautiful and industrious the other ugly and lazy. The motherhowever loved the ugly and lazy one best because she was her owndaughter and so the other who was only her stepdaughter was madeto do all the work of the house and was quite the Cinderella of thefamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well inthe high road there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now itchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle and as the girlstopped over the well to wash it off the spindle suddenly sprang outof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of hermisfortune but her stepmother spoke harshly to her and after givingher a violent scolding said unkindly As you have let the spindle fallinto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do and at last inher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in abeautiful meadow full of sunshine and with countless flowers bloomingin every direction.She walked over the meadow and presently she came upon a bakers ovenfull of bread and the loaves cried out to her Take us out take usout or alas we shall be burnt to a cinder we were baked through longago. So she took the breadshovel and drew them all out.She went on a little farther till she came to a tree full of apples.Shake me shake me I pray cried the tree my apples one and allare ripe. So she shook the tree and the apples came falling down uponher like rain but she continued shaking until there was not a singleapple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in aheap and walked on again.The next thing she came to was a little house and there she saw an oldwoman looking out with such large teeth that she was terrified andturned to run away. But the old woman called after her What are youafraid of dear child Stay with me if you will do the work of my houseproperly for me I will make you very happy. You must be very carefulhowever to make my bed in the right way for I wish you always to shakeit thoroughly so that the feathers fly about then they say down therein the world that it is snowing for I am Mother Holle. The old womanspoke so kindly that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enterinto her service.She took care to do everything according to the old womans bidding andevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might so that thefeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as goodas her word she never spoke angrily to her and gave her roast andboiled meats every day.So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time and then she beganto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad but shebecame conscious at last of great longing to go home then she knew shewas homesick although she was a thousand times better off with MotherHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile she wentto Mother Holle and said I am so homesick that I cannot stay withyou any longer for although I am so happy here I must return to my ownpeople.Then Mother Holle said I am pleased that you should want to go backto your own people and as you have served me so well and faithfully Iwill take you home myself.Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gatewas opened and as the girl passed through a shower of gold fell uponher and the gold clung to her so that she was covered with it fromhead to foot.That is a reward for your industry said Mother Holle and as shespoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.The gate was then closed and the girl found herself back in the oldworld close to her mothers house. As she entered the courtyard thecock who was perched on the well called out Cockadoodledoo  Your golden daughters come back to you.Then she went in to her mother and sister and as she was so richlycovered with gold they gave her a warm welcome. She related to themall that had happened and when the mother heard how she had come by hergreat riches she thought she should like her ugly lazy daughter to goand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the welland spin and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into athornbush so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle thenshe threw it into the well and jumped in herself.Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow and walked over ittill she came to the oven. Take us out take us out or alas we shallbe burnt to a cinder we were baked through long ago cried the loavesas before. But the lazy girl answered Do you think I am going to dirtymy hands for you and walked on.Presently she came to the appletree. Shake me shake me I pray myapples one and all are ripe it cried. But she only answered A nicething to ask me to do one of the apples might fall on my head andpassed on.At last she came to Mother Holles house and as she had heard all aboutthe large teeth from her sister she was not afraid of them and engagedherself without delay to the old woman.The first day she was very obedient and industrious and exerted herselfto please Mother Holle for she thought of the gold she should get inreturn. The next day however she began to dawdle over her work andthe third day she was more idle still then she began to lie in bed inthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still she neglected tomake the old womans bed properly and forgot to shake it so that thefeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of herand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this andthought to herself The gold will soon be mine. Mother Holle led heras she had led her sister to the broad gateway but as she was passingthrough instead of the shower of gold a great bucketful of pitch camepouring over her.That is in return for your services said the old woman and she shutthe gate.So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch and the cock on thewell called out as she saw her Cockadoodledoo  Your dirty daughters come back to you.But try what she would she could not get the pitch off and it stuck toher as long as she lived.LITTLE REDCAP LITTLE RED RIDING HOODOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyonewho looked at her but most of all by her grandmother and there wasnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her alittle cap of red velvet which suited her so well that she would neverwear anything else so she was always called Little RedCap.One day her mother said to her Come Little RedCap here is a pieceof cake and a bottle of wine take them to your grandmother she is illand weak and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot andwhen you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the pathor you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother willget nothing and when you go into her room dont forget to say Goodmorning and dont peep into every corner before you do it.I will take great care said Little RedCap to her mother and gaveher hand on it.The grandmother lived out in the wood half a league from the villageand just as Little RedCap entered the wood a wolf met her. RedCapdid not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid ofhim.Good day Little RedCap said he.Thank you kindly wolf.Whither away so early Little RedCapTo my grandmothers.What have you got in your apronCake and wine yesterday was bakingday so poor sick grandmother is tohave something good to make her stronger.Where does your grandmother live Little RedCapA good quarter of a league farther on in the wood her house standsunder the three large oaktrees the nuttrees are just below yousurely must know it replied Little RedCap.The wolf thought to himself What a tender young creature what a niceplump mouthfulshe will be better to eat than the old woman. I mustact craftily so as to catch both. So he walked for a short time bythe side of Little RedCap and then he said See Little RedCap howpretty the flowers are about herewhy do you not look round I believetoo that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing youwalk gravely along as if you were going to school while everything elseout here in the wood is merry.Little RedCap raised her eyes and when she saw the sunbeams dancinghere and there through the trees and pretty flowers growing everywhereshe thought Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay that wouldplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get therein good time and so she ran from the path into the wood to look forflowers. And whenever she had picked one she fancied that she saw astill prettier one farther on and ran after it and so got deeper anddeeper into the wood.Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmothers house and knockedat the door.Who is thereLittle RedCap replied the wolf. She is bringing cake and wine openthe door.Lift the latch called out the grandmother I am too weak and cannotget up.The wolf lifted the latch the door sprang open and without saying aword he went straight to the grandmothers bed and devoured her. Thenhe put on her clothes dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bedand drew the curtains.Little RedCap however had been running about picking flowersand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more sheremembered her grandmother and set out on the way to her.She was surprised to find the cottagedoor standing open and when shewent into the room she had such a strange feeling that she said toherself Oh dear how uneasy I feel today and at other times I likebeing with grandmother so much. She called out Good morning butreceived no answer so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face andlooking very strange.Oh grandmother she said what big ears you haveThe better to hear you with my child was the reply.But grandmother what big eyes you have she said.The better to see you with my dear.But grandmother what large hands you haveThe better to hug you with.Oh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you haveThe better to eat you withAnd scarcely had the wolf said this than with one bound he was out ofbed and swallowed up RedCap.When the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bedfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passingthe house and thought to himself How the old woman is snoring I mustjust see if she wants anything. So he went into the room and when hecame to the bed he saw that the wolf was lying in it. Do I find youhere you old sinner said he. I have long sought you Then just ashe was going to fire at him it occurred to him that the wolf might havedevoured the grandmother and that she might still be saved so he didnot fire but took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the stomachof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips he saw the littleRedCap shining and then he made two snips more and the little girlsprang out crying Ah how frightened I have been How dark it wasinside the wolf and after that the aged grandmother came out alivealso but scarcely able to breathe. RedCap however quickly fetchedgreat stones with which they filled the wolfs belly and when he awokehe wanted to run away but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed atonce and fell dead.Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolfs skin andwent home with it the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine whichRedCap had brought and revived but RedCap thought to herself Aslong as I live I will never by myself leave the path to run into thewood when my mother has forbidden me to do so.It also related that once when RedCap was again taking cakes to the oldgrandmother another wolf spoke to her and tried to entice her from thepath. RedCap however was on her guard and went straight forward onher way and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf and that hehad said good morning to her but with such a wicked look in his eyesthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he wouldhave eaten her up. Well said the grandmother we will shut the doorthat he may not come in. Soon afterwards the wolf knocked and criedOpen the door grandmother I am Little RedCap and am bringing yousome cakes. But they did not speak or open the door so the greybeardstole twice or thrice round the house and at last jumped on the roofintending to wait until RedCap went home in the evening and then tosteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmothersaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stonetrough so she said to the child Take the pail RedCap I made somesausages yesterday so carry the water in which I boiled them to thetrough. RedCap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then thesmell of the sausages reached the wolf and he sniffed and peeped downand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keephis footing and began to slip and slipped down from the roof straightinto the great trough and was drowned. But RedCap went joyously homeand no one ever did anything to harm her again.THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOMThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter and as she wasgrown up he was anxious that she should be well married and providedfor. He said to himself I will give her to the first suitable man whocomes and asks for her hand. Not long after a suitor appeared and ashe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him withwhich to find fault he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl didnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.She did not feel that she could trust him and she could not look at himnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her Youhave not yet paid me a visit although we have been betrothed for sometime. I do not know where your house is she answered. My house isout there in the dark forest he said. She tried to excuse herself bysaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothedonly replied You must come and see me next Sunday I have alreadyinvited guests for that day and that you may not mistake the way Iwill strew ashes along the path.When Sunday came and it was time for the girl to start a feeling ofdread came over her which she could not explain and that she mightbe able to find her path again she filled her pockets with peas andlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching theentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes and theseshe followed throwing down some peas on either side of her at everystep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepestdarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house looking sogrim and mysterious that it did not please her at all. She steppedinside but not a soul was to be seen and a great silence reignedthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried Turn back turn back young maiden fair  Linger not in this murderers lair.The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in acage on the wall. Again it cried Turn back turn back young maiden fair  Linger not in this murderers lair.The girl passed on going from room to room of the house but they wereall empty and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellarand there sat a very very old woman who could not keep her head fromshaking. Can you tell me asked the girl if my betrothed husbandlives hereAh you poor child answered the old woman what a place for you tocome to This is a murderers den. You think yourself a promised brideand that your marriage will soon take place but it is with death thatyou will keep your marriage feast. Look do you see that large cauldronof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire As soon as they haveyou in their power they will kill you without mercy and cook and eatyou for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and saveyou you would be lost.Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask which quite hid herfrom view. Keep as still as a mouse she said do not move or speakor it will be all over with you. Tonight when the robbers areall asleep we will flee together. I have long been waiting for anopportunity to escape.The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returneddragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk andpaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drinkthree glasses full one of white wine one of red and one of yellowand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off herdainty clothing laid her on a table and cut her beautiful body intopieces and sprinkled salt upon it.The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind thecask for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her bythe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining onthe little finger of the murdered girl and as he could not draw it offeasily he took a hatchet and cut off the finger but the finger spranginto the air and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who washiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it but hecould not find it. Have you looked behind the large cask said one ofthe others. But the old woman called out Come and eat your suppersand let the thing be till tomorrow the finger wont run away.The old woman is right said the robbers and they ceased looking forthe finger and sat down.The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine and beforelong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar fast asleep andsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this she came from behindthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers whowere lying close together and every moment she was filled with reneweddread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her so that shepassed safely over them and then she and the old woman went upstairsopened the door and hastened as fast as they could from the murderersden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind but the peas andlentils had sprouted and grown sufficiently above the ground to guidethem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked and itwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her fatherall that had happened.The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroomarrived and also a large company of guests for the miller had takencare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feasteach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale the bride sat still and didnot say a word.And you my love said the bridegroom turning to her is there notale you know Tell us something.I will tell you a dream then said the bride. I went alone through aforest and came at last to a house not a soul could I find within buta bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried Turn back turn back young maiden fair  Linger not in this murderers lair.and again a second time it said these words.My darling this is only a dream.I went on through the house from room to room but they were all emptyand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to thecellar and there sat a very very old woman who could not keep herhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here and she answeredAh you poor child you are come to a murderers den your betrotheddoes indeed live here but he will kill you without mercy and afterwardscook and eat you.My darling this is only a dream.The old woman hid me behind a large cask and scarcely had she donethis when the robbers returned home dragging a young girl along withthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink white red andyellow and with that she died.My darling this is only a dream.Then they tore off her dainty clothing and cut her beautiful body intopieces and sprinkled salt upon it.My darling this is only a dream.And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on herfinger and as it was difficult to draw off he took a hatchet and cutoff her finger but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind thegreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring. Andwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to theassembled guests.The bridegroom who during this recital had grown deadly pale up andtried to escape but the guests seized him and held him fast. Theydelivered him up to justice and he and all his murderous band werecondemned to death for their wicked deeds.TOM THUMBA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night smoking his pipe by thefireside while his wife sat by his side spinning. How lonely it iswife said he as he puffed out a long curl of smoke for you and meto sit here by ourselves without any children to play about and amuseus while other people seem so happy and merry with their childrenWhat you say is very true said the wife sighing and turning roundher wheel how happy should I be if I had but one child If it wereever so smallnay if it were no bigger than my thumbI should be veryhappy and love it dearly. Nowodd as you may think itit came topass that this good womans wish was fulfilled just in the very way shehad wished it for not long afterwards she had a little boy who wasquite healthy and strong but was not much bigger than my thumb. Sothey said Well we cannot say we have not got what we wished for andlittle as he is we will love him dearly. And they called him ThomasThumb.They gave him plenty of food yet for all they could do he never grewbigger but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.Still his eyes were sharp and sparkling and he soon showed himself tobe a clever little fellow who always knew well what he was about.One day as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cutfuel he said I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me for Iwant to make haste. Oh father cried Tom I will take care of thatthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it. Then the woodmanlaughed and said How can that be you cannot reach up to the horsesbridle. Never mind that father said Tom if my mother will onlyharness the horse I will get into his ear and tell him which way togo. Well said the father we will try for once.When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart and putTom into his ear and as he sat there the little man told the beast howto go crying out Go on and Stop as he wanted and thus the horsewent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into thewood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast and Tomwas calling out Gently gently two strangers came up. What an oddthing that is said one there is a cart going along and I hear acarter talking to the horse but yet I can see no one. That is queerindeed said the other let us follow the cart and see where itgoes. So they went on into the wood till at last they came to theplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb seeing his father criedout See father here I am with the cart all right and safe now takeme down So his father took hold of the horse with one hand and withthe other took his son out of the horses ear and put him down upon astraw where he sat as merry as you please.The two strangers were all this time looking on and did not know whatto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside and said Thatlittle urchin will make our fortune if we can get him and carry himabout from town to town as a show we must buy him. So they went up tothe woodman and asked him what he would take for the little man. Hewill be better off said they with us than with you. I wont sellhim at all said the father my own flesh and blood is dearer to methan all the silver and gold in the world. But Tom hearing of thebargain they wanted to make crept up his fathers coat to his shoulderand whispered in his ear Take the money father and let them have meIll soon come back to you.So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for alarge piece of gold and they paid the price. Where would you like tosit said one of them. Oh put me on the rim of your hat that will bea nice gallery for me I can walk about there and see the country as wego along. So they did as he wished and when Tom had taken leave of hisfather they took him away with them.They journeyed on till it began to be dusky and then the little mansaid Let me get down Im tired. So the man took off his hat andput him down on a clod of earth in a ploughed field by the side of theroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows and at last slipped intoan old mousehole. Good night my masters said he Im off mind andlook sharp after me the next time. Then they ran at once to the placeand poked the ends of their sticks into the mousehole but all in vainTom only crawled farther and farther in and at last it became quitedark so that they were forced to go their way without their prize assulky as could be.When Tom found they were gone he came out of his hidingplace. Whatdangerous walking it is said he in this ploughed field If I were tofall from one of these great clods I should undoubtedly break my neck.At last by good luck he found a large empty snailshell. This islucky said he I can sleep here very well and in he crept.Just as he was falling asleep he heard two men passing by chattingtogether and one said to the other How can we rob that rich parsonshouse of his silver and gold Ill tell you cried Tom. What noisewas that said the thief frightened Im sure I heard someone speak.They stood still listening and Tom said Take me with you and Illsoon show you how to get the parsons money. But where are you saidthey. Look about on the ground answered he and listen where thesound comes from. At last the thieves found him out and lifted himup in their hands. You little urchin they said what can you do forus Why I can get between the iron windowbars of the parsons houseand throw you out whatever you want. Thats a good thought said thethieves come along we shall see what you can do.When they came to the parsons house Tom slipped through thewindowbars into the room and then called out as loud as he could bawlWill you have all that is here At this the thieves were frightenedand said Softly softly Speak low that you may not awaken anybody.But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them and bawled out againHow much will you have Shall I throw it all out Now the cook lay inthe next room and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed andlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened and ran off a littleway but at last they plucked up their hearts and said The littleurchin is only trying to make fools of us. So they came back andwhispered softly to him saying Now let us have no more of yourroguish jokes but throw us out some of the money. Then Tom called outas loud as he could Very well hold your hands here it comes.The cook heard this quite plain so she sprang out of bed and ran toopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails andthe maid having groped about and found nothing went away for a light.By the time she came back Tom had slipped off into the barn and whenshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner and foundnobody she went to bed thinking she must have been dreaming with hereyes open.The little man crawled about in the hayloft and at last found a snugplace to finish his nights rest in so he laid himself down meaningto sleep till daylight and then find his way home to his father andmother. But alas how woefully he was undone what crosses and sorrowshappen to us all in this world The cook got up early before daybreakto feed the cows and going straight to the hayloft carried awaya large bundle of hay with the little man in the middle of it fastasleep. He still however slept on and did not awake till he foundhimself in the mouth of the cow for the cook had put the hay into thecows rick and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. Goodlackaday said he how came I to tumble into the mill But he soonfound out where he really was and was forced to have all his wits abouthim that he might not get between the cows teeth and so be crushed todeath. At last down he went into her stomach. It is rather dark saidhe they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in acandle would be no bad thing.Though he made the best of his bad luck he did not like his quarters atall and the worst of it was that more and more hay was always comingdown and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last hecried out as loud as he could Dont bring me any more hay Dont bringme any more hayThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow and hearing someonespeak but seeing nobody and yet being quite sure it was the same voicethat she had heard in the night she was so frightened that she fell offher stool and overset the milkpail. As soon as she could pick herselfup out of the dirt she ran off as fast as she could to her master theparson and said Sir sir the cow is talking But the parsonsaid Woman thou art surely mad However he went with her into thecowhouse to try and see what was the matter.Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold when Tom called out Dontbring me any more hay Then the parson himself was frightened andthinking the cow was surely bewitched told his man to kill her on thespot. So the cow was killed and cut up and the stomach in which Tomlay was thrown out upon a dunghill.Tom soon set himself to work to get out which was not a very easytask but at last just as he had made room to get his head out freshillluck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out and swallowed up thewhole stomach with Tom in it at one gulp and ran away.Tom however was still not disheartened and thinking the wolf wouldnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along he calledout My good friend I can show you a famous treat. Wheres thatsaid the wolf. In such and such a house said Tom describing his ownfathers house. You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen andthen into the pantry and there you will find cakes ham beef coldchicken roast pig appledumplings and everything that your heart canwish.The wolf did not want to be asked twice so that very night he went tothe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen and then intothe pantry and ate and drank there to his hearts content. As soon ashe had had enough he wanted to get away but he had eaten so much thathe could not go out by the same way he came in.This was just what Tom had reckoned upon and now he began to set up agreat shout making all the noise he could. Will you be easy said thewolf youll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.Whats that to me said the little man you have had your frolic nowIve a mind to be merry myself and he began singing and shouting asloud as he could.The woodman and his wife being awakened by the noise peeped througha crack in the door but when they saw a wolf was there you may wellsuppose that they were sadly frightened and the woodman ran for hisaxe and gave his wife a scythe. Do you stay behind said the woodmanand when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with thescythe. Tom heard all this and cried out Father father I am herethe wolf has swallowed me. And his father said Heaven be praised wehave found our dear child again and he told his wife not to use thescythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow andstruck the wolf on the head and killed him on the spot and when he wasdead they cut open his body and set Tommy free. Ah said the fatherwhat fears we have had for you Yes father answered he I havetravelled all over the world I think in one way or other since weparted and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.Why where have you been said his father. I have been in amouseholeand in a snailshelland down a cows throatand in thewolfs belly and yet here I am again safe and sound.Well said they you are come back and we will not sell you againfor all the riches in the world.Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son and gave him plentyto eat and drink for he was very hungry and then they fetched newclothes for him for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother in peace forthough he had been so great a traveller and had done and seen so manyfine things and was fond enough of telling the whole story he alwaysagreed that after all theres no place like HOMERUMPELSTILTSKINBy the side of a wood in a country a long way off ran a fine streamof water and upon the stream there stood a mill. The millers house wasclose by and the miller you must know had a very beautiful daughter.She was moreover very shrewd and clever and the miller was so proudof her that he one day told the king of the land who used to come andhunt in the wood that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Nowthis king was very fond of money and when he heard the millers boasthis greediness was raised and he sent for the girl to be brought beforehim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a greatheap of straw and gave her a spinningwheel and said All this mustbe spun into gold before morning as you love your life. It was in vainthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her fatherfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold the chamberdoor was locked and she was left alone.She sat down in one corner of the room and began to bewail her hardfate when on a sudden the door opened and a drolllooking little manhobbled in and said Good morrow to you my good lass what are youweeping for Alas said she I must spin this straw into gold andI know not how. What will you give me said the hobgoblin to do itfor you My necklace replied the maiden. He took her at her wordand sat himself down to the wheel and whistled and sang Round about round about    Lo and behold  Reel away reel away    Straw into goldAnd round about the wheel went merrily the work was quickly done andthe straw was all spun into gold.When the king came and saw this he was greatly astonished and pleasedbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain and he shut up the poormillers daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to doand sat down once more to weep but the dwarf soon opened the door andsaid What will you give me to do your task The ring on my fingersaid she. So her little friend took the ring and began to work at thewheel again and whistled and sang Round about round about    Lo and behold  Reel away reel away    Straw into goldtill long before morning all was done again.The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasurebut still he had not enough so he took the millers daughter to a yetlarger heap and said All this must be spun tonight and if it isyou shall be my queen. As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in andsaid What will you give me to spin gold for you this third timeI have nothing left said she. Then say you will give me saidthe little man the first little child that you may have when you arequeen. That may never be thought the millers daughter and as sheknew no other way to get her task done she said she would do what heasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song and the manikin oncemore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning and findingall he wanted was forced to keep his word so he married the millersdaughter and she really became queen.At the birth of her first little child she was very glad and forgot thedwarf and what she had said. But one day he came into her room whereshe was sitting playing with her baby and put her in mind of it. Thenshe grieved sorely at her misfortune and said she would give him allthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off but in vain till atlast her tears softened him and he said I will give you three daysgrace and if during that time you tell me my name you shall keep yourchild.Now the queen lay awake all night thinking of all the odd names thatshe had ever heard and she sent messengers all over the land to findout new ones. The next day the little man came and she began withTIMOTHY ICHABOD BENJAMIN JEREMIAH and all the names she couldremember but to all and each of them he said Madam that is not myname.The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear ofBANDYLEGS HUNCHBACK CROOKSHANKS and so on but the little gentlemanstill said to every one of them Madam that is not my name.The third day one of the messengers came back and said I havetravelled two days without hearing of any other names but yesterday asI was climbing a high hill among the trees of the forest where the foxand the hare bid each other good night I saw a little hut and beforethe hut burnt a fire and round about the fire a funny little dwarf wasdancing upon one leg and singing Merrily the feast Ill make.  Today Ill brew tomorrow bake  Merrily Ill dance and sing  For next day will a stranger bring.  Little does my lady dream  Rumpelstiltskin is my nameWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy and as soon as her littlefriend came she sat down upon her throne and called all her court roundto enjoy the fun and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in herarms as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man beganto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child to take home withhim to his hut in the woods and he cried out Now lady what is myname Is it JOHN asked she. No madam Is it TOM No madamIs it JEMMY It is not. Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN said thelady slyly. Some witch told you thatsome witch told you that criedthe little man and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into thefloor that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull itout.Then he made the best of his way off while the nurse laughed and thebaby crowed and all the court jeered at him for having had so muchtrouble for nothing and said We wish you a very good morning and amerry feast Mr RUMPLESTILTSKINCLEVER GRETELThere was once a cook named Gretel who wore shoes with red heels andwhen she walked out with them on she turned herself this way and thatwas quite happy and thought You certainly are a pretty girl And whenshe came home she drank in her gladness of heart a draught of wineand as wine excites a desire to eat she tasted the best of whatever shewas cooking until she was satisfied and said The cook must know whatthe food is like.It came to pass that the master one day said to her Gretel there is aguest coming this evening prepare me two fowls very daintily. I willsee to it master answered Gretel. She killed two fowls scalded themplucked them put them on the spit and towards evening set them beforethe fire that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown and werenearly ready but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called outto her master If the guest does not come I must take the fowls awayfrom the fire but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eatenthe moment they are at their juiciest. The master said I will runmyself and fetch the guest. When the master had turned his backGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side and thought Standingso long by the fire there makes one sweat and thirsty who knowswhen they will come Meanwhile I will run into the cellar and take adrink. She ran down set a jug said God bless it for you Greteland took a good drink and thought that wine should flow on and shouldnot be interrupted and took yet another hearty draught.Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire basted themand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so goodGretel thought Something might be wrong it ought to be tastedShe touched it with her finger and said Ah how good fowls are Itcertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the righttime She ran to the window to see if the master was not coming withhis guest but she saw no one and went back to the fowls and thoughtOne of the wings is burning I had better take it off and eat it.So she cut it off ate it and enjoyed it and when she had done shethought The other must go down too or else master will observe thatsomething is missing. When the two wings were eaten she went andlooked for her master and did not see him. It suddenly occurred toher Who knows They are perhaps not coming at all and have turned insomewhere. Then she said Well Gretel enjoy yourself one fowl hasbeen cut into take another drink and eat it up entirely when it iseaten you will have some peace why should Gods good gifts be spoiltSo she ran into the cellar again took an enormous drink and ate up theone chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed downand still her master did not come Gretel looked at the other and saidWhat one is the other should be likewise the two go together whatsright for the one is right for the other I think if I were to takeanother draught it would do me no harm. So she took another heartydrink and let the second chicken follow the first.While she was making the most of it her master came and cried Hurryup Gretel the guest is coming directly after me Yes sir I willsoon serve up answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see thatthe table was properly laid and took the great knife wherewith he wasgoing to carve the chickens and sharpened it on the steps. Presentlythe guest came and knocked politely and courteously at the housedoor.Gretel ran and looked to see who was there and when she saw the guestshe put her finger to her lips and said Hush hush go away as quicklyas you can if my master catches you it will be the worse for you hecertainly did ask you to supper but his intention is to cut off yourtwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it The guestheard the sharpening and hurried down the steps again as fast as hecould. Gretel was not idle she ran screaming to her master and criedYou have invited a fine guest Why Gretel What do you mean bythat Yes said she he has taken the chickens which I was justgoing to serve up off the dish and has run away with them Thats anice trick said her master and lamented the fine chickens. If he hadbut left me one so that something remained for me to eat. He called tohim to stop but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after himwith the knife still in his hand crying Just one just one meaningthat the guest should leave him just one chicken and not take both. Theguest however thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one ofhis ears and ran as if fire were burning under him in order to takethem both with him.THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSONThere was once a very old man whose eyes had become dim his ears dullof hearing his knees trembled and when he sat at table he could hardlyhold the spoon and spilt the broth upon the tablecloth or let it runout of his mouth. His son and his sons wife were disgusted at this sothe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stoveand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl and not even enoughof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full oftears. Once too his trembling hands could not hold the bowl and itfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him but he saidnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a fewhalfpence out of which he had to eat.They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years oldbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. What areyou doing there asked the father. I am making a little troughanswered the child for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.The man and his wife looked at each other for a while and presentlybegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table andhenceforth always let him eat with them and likewise said nothing if hedid spill a little of anything.THE LITTLE PEASANTThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really richpeasants and just one poor one whom they called the little peasant. Hehad not even so much as a cow and still less money to buy one andyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to herListen I have a good idea there is our gossip the carpenter he shallmake us a wooden calf and paint it brown so that it looks like anyother and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow. the womanalso liked the idea and their gossip the carpenter cut and planedthe calf and painted it as it ought to be and made it with its headhanging down as if it were eating.Next morning when the cows were being driven out the little peasantcalled the cowherd in and said Look I have a little calf therebut it is still small and has to be carried. The cowherd said Allright and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture and setit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like onewhich was eating and the cowherd said It will soon run by itselfjust look how it eats already At night when he was going to drive theherd home again he said to the calf If you can stand there and eatyour fill you can also go on your four legs I dont care to drag youhome again in my arms. But the little peasant stood at his door andwaited for his little calf and when the cowherd drove the cows throughthe village and the calf was missing he inquired where it was. Thecowherd answered It is still standing out there eating. It would notstop and come with us. But the little peasant said Oh but I musthave my beast back again. Then they went back to the meadow togetherbut someone had stolen the calf and it was gone. The cowherd said Itmust have run away. The peasant however said Dont tell methat and led the cowherd before the mayor who for his carelessnesscondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they hadso long wished and they were heartily glad but they had no food forit and could give it nothing to eat so it soon had to be killed. Theysalted the flesh and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sellthe skin there so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. Onthe way he passed by a mill and there sat a raven with broken wingsand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as theweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind he couldgo no farther and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. Themillers wife was alone in the house and said to the peasant Layyourself on the straw there and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.The peasant ate it and lay down with his skin beside him and the womanthought He is tired and has gone to sleep. In the meantime came theparson the millers wife received him well and said My husband isout so we will have a feast. The peasant listened and when he heardthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to makeshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up fourdifferent things roast meat salad cakes and wine.Just as they were about to sit down and eat there was a knockingoutside. The woman said Oh heavens It is my husband she quicklyhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove the wine under the pillowthe salad on the bed the cakes under it and the parson in the closeton the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband and said Thankheaven you are back again There is such a storm it looks as if theworld were coming to an end. The miller saw the peasant lying on thestraw and asked What is that fellow doing there Ah said thewife the poor knave came in the storm and rain and begged forshelter so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese and showed him wherethe straw was. The man said I have no objection but be quick and getme something to eat. The woman said But I have nothing but bread andcheese. I am contented with anything replied the husband so far asI am concerned bread and cheese will do and looked at the peasant andsaid Come and eat some more with me. The peasant did not require tobe invited twice but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skinin which the raven was lying on the ground and asked What have youthere The peasant answered I have a soothsayer inside it. Canhe foretell anything to me said the miller. Why not answeredthe peasant but he only says four things and the fifth he keeps tohimself. The miller was curious and said Let him foretell somethingfor once. Then the peasant pinched the ravens head so that he croakedand made a noise like krr krr. The miller said What did he say Thepeasant answered In the first place he says that there is some winehidden under the pillow. Bless me cried the miller and went thereand found the wine. Now go on said he. The peasant made the ravencroak again and said In the second place he says that there is someroast meat in the tiled stove. Upon my word cried the miller andwent thither and found the roast meat. The peasant made the ravenprophesy still more and said Thirdly he says that there is somesalad on the bed. That would be a fine thing cried the miller andwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the ravenonce more till he croaked and said Fourthly he says that thereare some cakes under the bed. That would be a fine thing cried themiller and looked there and found the cakes.And now the two sat down to the table together but the millers wifewas frightened to death and went to bed and took all the keys withher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth but the littlepeasant said First we will quickly eat the four things for the fifthis something bad. So they ate and after that they bargained how muchthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy until they agreed onthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the ravenshead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked What did he say Thepeasant replied He says that the Devil is hiding outside there inthe closet on the porch. The miller said The Devil must go out andopened the housedoor then the woman was forced to give up the keysand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as hecould and the miller said It was true I saw the black rascal with myown eyes. The peasant however made off next morning by daybreak withthe three hundred talers.At home the small peasant gradually launched out he built a beautifulhouse and the peasants said The small peasant has certainly been tothe place where golden snow falls and people carry the gold home inshovels. Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor andbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered I sold my cowsskin in the town for three hundred talers. When the peasants heardthat they too wished to enjoy this great profit and ran home killedall their cows and stripped off their skins in order to sell them inthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor however said But myservant must go first. When she came to the merchant in the town hedid not give her more than two talers for a skin and when the otherscame he did not give them so much and said What can I do with allthese skinsThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thusoutwitted them wanted to take vengeance on him and accused him of thistreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimouslysentenced to death and was to be rolled into the water in a barrelpierced full of holes. He was led forth and a priest was brought whowas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire toa distance and when the peasant looked at the priest he recognized theman who had been with the millers wife. He said to him I set you freefrom the closet set me free from the barrel. At this same moment upcame with a flock of sheep the very shepherd whom the peasant knew hadlong been wishing to be mayor so he cried with all his might No Iwill not do it if the whole world insists on it I will not do it Theshepherd hearing that came up to him and asked What are you aboutWhat is it that you will not do The peasant said They want to makeme mayor if I will but put myself in the barrel but I will not do it.The shepherd said If nothing more than that is needful in order to bemayor I would get into the barrel at once. The peasant said If youwill get in you will be mayor. The shepherd was willing and got inand the peasant shut the top down on him then he took the shepherdsflock for himself and drove it away. The parson went to the crowdand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled thebarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll the shepherdcried I am quite willing to be mayor. They believed no otherwise thanthat it was the peasant who was saying this and answered That iswhat we intend but first you shall look about you a little down belowthere and they rolled the barrel down into the water.After that the peasants went home and as they were entering thevillage the small peasant also came quietly in driving a flock ofsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonishedand said Peasant from whence do you come Have you come out of thewater Yes truly replied the peasant I sank deep deep downuntil at last I got to the bottom I pushed the bottom out of thebarrel and crept out and there were pretty meadows on which a numberof lambs were feeding and from thence I brought this flock away withme. Said the peasants Are there any more there Oh yes said hemore than I could want. Then the peasants made up their minds thatthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves a flock apiece but themayor said I come first. So they went to the water together and justthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky whichare called little lambs and they were reflected in the water whereuponthe peasants cried We already see the sheep down below The mayorpressed forward and said I will go down first and look about me andif things promise well Ill call you. So he jumped in splash wentthe water it sounded as if he were calling them and the whole crowdplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead andthe small peasant as sole heir became a rich man.FREDERICK AND CATHERINEThere was once a man called Frederick he had a wife whose name wasCatherine and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.Kate I am going to work in the fields when I come back I shall behungry so let me have something nice cooked and a good draught of ale.Very well said she it shall all be ready. When dinnertime drewnigh Catherine took a nice steak which was all the meat she had andput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown and tocrackle in the pan and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned itthen she said to herself The steak is almost ready I may as well goto the cellar for the ale. So she left the pan on the fire and took alarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer raninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into herhead The dog is not shut uphe may be running away with the steakthats well thought of. So up she ran from the cellar and sure enoughthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth and was making off withit.Away ran Catherine and away ran the dog across the field but he ranfaster than she and stuck close to the steak. Its all gone and whatcant be cured must be endured said Catherine. So she turned roundand as she had run a good way and was tired she walked home leisurelyto cool herself.Now all this time the ale was running too for Catherine had not turnedthe cock and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor tillthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what hadhappened. My stars said she what shall I do to keep Frederick fromseeing all this slopping about So she thought a while and at lastremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fairand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the alenicely. What a lucky thing said she that we kept that meal we havenow a good use for it. So away she went for it but she managed to setit down just upon the great jug full of beer and upset it and thusall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. Ahwell said she when one goes another may as well follow. Then shestrewed the meal all about the cellar and was quite pleased with hercleverness and said How very neat and clean it looksAt noon Frederick came home. Now wife cried he what have you fordinner O Frederick answered she I was cooking you a steak butwhile I went down to draw the ale the dog ran away with it and whileI ran after him the ale ran out and when I went to dry up the alewith the sack of meal that we got at the fair I upset the jug but thecellar is now quite dry and looks so clean Kate Kate said hehow could you do all this Why did you leave the steak to fry and theale to run and then spoil all the meal Why Frederick said she Idid not know I was doing wrong you should have told me before.The husband thought to himself If my wife manages matters thus I mustlook sharp myself. Now he had a good deal of gold in the house so hesaid to Catherine What pretty yellow buttons these are I shall putthem into a box and bury them in the garden but take care that younever go near or meddle with them. No Frederick said she thatI never will. As soon as he was gone there came by some pedlars withearthenware plates and dishes and they asked her whether she would buy.Oh dear me I should like to buy very much but I have no money ifyou had any use for yellow buttons I might deal with you. Yellowbuttons said they let us have a look at them. Go into the gardenand dig where I tell you and you will find the yellow buttons I darenot go myself. So the rogues went and when they found what theseyellow buttons were they took them all away and left her plenty ofplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a showand when Frederick came back he cried out Kate what have you beendoing See said she I have bought all these with your yellowbuttons but I did not touch them myself the pedlars went themselvesand dug them up. Wife wife said Frederick what a pretty piece ofwork you have made those yellow buttons were all my money how came youto do such a thing Why answered she I did not know there was anyharm in it you should have told me.Catherine stood musing for a while and at last said to her husbandHark ye Frederick we will soon get the gold back let us run afterthe thieves. Well we will try answered he but take some butterand cheese with you that we may have something to eat by the way.Very well said she and they set out and as Frederick walked thefastest he left his wife some way behind. It does not matter thoughtshe when we turn back I shall be so much nearer home than he.Presently she came to the top of a hill down the side of which therewas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the treeson each side as they passed. Ah see now said she how they havebruised and wounded those poor trees they will never get well. So shetook pity on them and made use of the butter to grease them all sothat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing thiskind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket and rolled downthe hill. Catherine looked but could not see where it had gone so shesaid Well I suppose the other will go the same way and find you hehas younger legs than I have. Then she rolled the other cheese afterit and away it went nobody knows where down the hill. But she saidshe supposed that they knew the road and would follow her and shecould not stay there all day waiting for them.At last she overtook Frederick who desired her to give him something toeat. Then she gave him the dry bread. Where are the butter and cheesesaid he. Oh answered she I used the butter to grease those poortrees that the wheels chafed so and one of the cheeses ran away so Isent the other after it to find it and I suppose they are both onthe road together somewhere. What a goose you are to do such sillythings said the husband. How can you say so said she I am sureyou never told me not.They ate the dry bread together and Frederick said Kate I hope youlocked the door safe when you came away. No answered she you didnot tell me. Then go home and do it now before we go any farthersaid Frederick and bring with you something to eat.Catherine did as he told her and thought to herself by the wayFrederick wants something to eat but I dont think he is very fond ofbutter and cheese Ill bring him a bag of fine nuts and the vinegarfor I have often seen him take some.When she reached home she bolted the back door but the front door shetook off the hinges and said Frederick told me to lock the door butsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me. So she tookher time by the way and when she overtook her husband she criedout There Frederick there is the door itself you may watch it ascarefully as you please. Alas alas said he what a clever wife Ihave I sent you to make the house fast and you take the door away sothat everybody may go in and out as they pleasehowever as you havebrought the door you shall carry it about with you for your pains.Very well answered she Ill carry the door but Ill not carry thenuts and vinegar bottle alsothat would be too much of a load so ifyou please Ill fasten them to the door.Frederick of course made no objection to that plan and they set offinto the wood to look for the thieves but they could not find them andwhen it grew dark they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.Scarcely were they up than who should come by but the very rogues theywere looking for. They were in truth great rascals and belonged to thatclass of people who find things before they are lost they were tiredso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick andCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side and picked upsome stones. Then he climbed up again and tried to hit the thieves onthe head with them but they only said It must be near morning forthe wind shakes the firapples down.Catherine who had the door on her shoulder began to be very tiredbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy so she saidsoftly Frederick I must let the nuts go. No answered he notnow they will discover us. I cant help that they must go. Wellthen make haste and throw them down if you will. Then away rattledthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried Bless meit is hailing.A little while after Catherine thought the door was still very heavyso she whispered to Frederick I must throw the vinegar down. Praydont answered he it will discover us. I cant help that saidshe go it must. So she poured all the vinegar down and the thievessaid What a heavy dew there isAt last it popped into Catherines head that it was the door itself thatwas so heavy all the time so she whispered Frederick I must throwthe door down soon. But he begged and prayed her not to do so for hewas sure it would betray them. Here goes however said she and downwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves that they criedout Murder and not knowing what was coming ran away as fast as theycould and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came downthere they found all their money safe and sound.SWEETHEART ROLANDThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had twodaughters one ugly and wicked and this one she loved because she washer own daughter and one beautiful and good and this one she hatedbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a prettyapron which the other fancied so much that she became envious andtold her mother that she must and would have that apron. Be quiet mychild said the old woman and you shall have it. Your stepsister haslong deserved death tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut herhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed andpush her well to the front. It would have been all over with the poorgirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner and heardeverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors and when bedtimehad come the witchs daughter got into bed first so as to lie at thefar side but when she was asleep the other pushed her gently to thefront and took for herself the place at the back close by the wall. Inthe night the old woman came creeping in she held an axe in her righthand and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outsideand then she grasped the axe with both hands and cut her own childshead off.When she had gone away the girl got up and went to her sweetheart whowas called Roland and knocked at his door. When he came out she saidto him Listen dearest Roland we must fly in all haste my stepmotherwanted to kill me but has struck her own child. When daylight comesand she sees what she has done we shall be lost. But said RolandI counsel you first to take away her magic wand or we cannot escapeif she pursues us. The maiden fetched the magic wand and she took thedead girls head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground one infront of the bed one in the kitchen and one on the stairs. Then shehurried away with her lover.When the old witch got up next morning she called her daughter andwanted to give her the apron but she did not come. Then the witchcried Where are you Here on the stairs I am sweeping answeredthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out but saw no one on thestairs and cried again Where are you Here in the kitchen I amwarming myself cried the second drop of blood. She went into thekitchen but found no one. Then she cried again Where are you Ahhere in the bed I am sleeping cried the third drop of blood. She wentinto the room to the bed. What did she see there Her own childwhose head she had cut off bathed in her blood. The witch fell intoa passion sprang to the window and as she could look forth quite farinto the world she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with hersweetheart Roland. That shall not help you cried she even if youhave got a long way off you shall still not escape me. She put on hermanyleague boots in which she covered an hours walk at every stepand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl however whenshe saw the old woman striding towards her changed with her magicwand her sweetheart Roland into a lake and herself into a duckswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shorethrew breadcrumbs in and went to endless trouble to entice the duckbut the duck did not let herself be enticed and the old woman had togo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheartRoland resumed their natural shapes again and they walked on the wholenight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautifulflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge and her sweetheartRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding uptowards them and said to the musician Dear musician may I pluck thatbeautiful flower for myself Oh yes he replied I will play toyou while you do it. As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and wasjust going to pluck the flower knowing perfectly well who the flowerwas he began to play and whether she would or not she was forcedto dance for it was a magical dance. The faster he played the moreviolent springs was she forced to make and the thorns tore her clothesfrom her body and pricked her and wounded her till she bled and as hedid not stop she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.As they were now set free Roland said Now I will go to my father andarrange for the wedding. Then in the meantime I will stay here andwait for you said the girl and that no one may recognize me I willchange myself into a red stone landmark. Then Roland went away and thegirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.But when Roland got home he fell into the snares of another who sofascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there along time but at length as he did not return at all she was sad andchanged herself into a flower and thought Someone will surely comethis way and trample me down.It befell however that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and sawthe flower and as it was so pretty plucked it took it with him andlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth strange things happenedin the shepherds house. When he arose in the morning all the work wasalready done the room was swept the table and benches cleaned thefire in the hearth was lighted and the water was fetched and at noonwhen he came home the table was laid and a good dinner served. Hecould not conceive how this came to pass for he never saw a human beingin his house and no one could have concealed himself in it. He wascertainly pleased with this good attendance but still at last he was soafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wisewoman said There is some enchantment behind it listen very early somemorning if anything is moving in the room and if you see anything nomatter what it is throw a white cloth over it and then the magic willbe stopped.The shepherd did as she bade him and next morning just as day dawnedhe saw the chest open and the flower come out. Swiftly hesprang towards it and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly thetransformation came to an end and a beautiful girl stood before himwho admitted to him that she had been the flower and that up to thistime she had attended to his housekeeping. She told him her storyand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him but sheanswered No for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheartRoland although he had deserted her. Nevertheless she promised not togo away but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.And now the time drew near when Rolands wedding was to be celebratedand then according to an old custom in the country it was announcedthat all the girls were to be present at it and sing in honour of thebridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this she grew so sadthat she thought her heart would break and she would not go thitherbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to singshe stepped back until at last she was the only one left and then shecould not refuse. But when she began her song and it reached Rolandsears he sprang up and cried I know the voice that is the truebride I will have no other Everything he had forgotten and which hadvanished from his mind had suddenly come home again to his heart. Thenthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland andgrief came to an end and joy began.SNOWDROPIt was the middle of winter when the broad flakes of snow were fallingaround that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat workingat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony andas she sat looking out upon the snow she pricked her finger and threedrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the reddrops that sprinkled the white snow and said Would that my littledaughter may be as white as that snow as red as that blood and asblack as this ebony windowframe And so the little girl really did growup her skin was as white as snow her cheeks as rosy as the blood andher hair as black as ebony and she was called Snowdrop.But this queen died and the king soon married another wife who becamequeen and was very beautiful but so vain that she could not bearto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairylookingglass to which she used to go and then she would gaze uponherself in it and say Tell me glass tell me true  Of all the ladies in the land  Who is fairest tell me whoAnd the glass had always answered Thou queen art the fairest in all the land.But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful and when she was seven yearsold she was as bright as the day and fairer than the queen herself.Then the glass one day answered the queen when she went to look in itas usual Thou queen art fair and beauteous to see  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than theeWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy and called toone of her servants and said Take Snowdrop away into the wide woodthat I may never see her any more. Then the servant led her away buthis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life and hesaid I will not hurt you thou pretty child. So he left her byherself and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts wouldtear her in pieces he felt as if a great weight were taken off hisheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her toher fate with the chance of someone finding and saving her.Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear andthe wild beasts roared about her but none did her any harm. In theevening she came to a cottage among the hills and went in to rest forher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce andneat in the cottage on the table was spread a white cloth and therewere seven little plates seven little loaves and seven little glasseswith wine in them and seven knives and forks laid in order and bythe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry she pickeda little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of eachglass and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So shetried all the little beds but one was too long and another was tooshort till at last the seventh suited her and there she laid herselfdown and went to sleep.By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven littledwarfs that lived among the mountains and dug and searched for gold.They lighted up their seven lamps and saw at once that all was notright. The first said Who has been sitting on my stool The secondWho has been eating off my plate The third Who has been picking mybread The fourth Who has been meddling with my spoon The fifthWho has been handling my fork The sixth Who has been cutting withmy knife The seventh Who has been drinking my wine Then the firstlooked round and said Who has been lying on my bed And the rest camerunning to him and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon hisbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop and called all his brethren to comeand see her and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and broughttheir lamps to look at her and said Good heavens what a lovely childshe is And they were very glad to see her and took care not to wakeher and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfsin turn till the night was gone.In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story and they pitied herand said if she would keep all things in order and cook and wash andknit and spin for them she might stay where she was and they wouldtake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their workseeking for gold and silver in the mountains but Snowdrop was left athome and they warned her and said The queen will soon find out whereyou are so take care and let no one in.But the queen now that she thought Snowdrop was dead believed that shemust be the handsomest lady in the land and she went to her glass andsaid Tell me glass tell me true  Of all the ladies in the land  Who is fairest tell me whoAnd the glass answered Thou queen art the fairest in all this land  But over the hills in the greenwood shade  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made  There Snowdrop is hiding her head and she  Is lovelier far O queen than thee.Then the queen was very much frightened for she knew that the glassalways spoke the truth and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautifulthan she was so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar and wenther way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then sheknocked at the door and cried Fine wares to sell Snowdrop lookedout at the window and said Good day good woman what have you tosell Good wares fine wares said she laces and bobbins of allcolours. I will let the old lady in she seems to be a very goodsort of body thought Snowdrop as she ran down and unbolted the door.Bless me said the old woman how badly your stays are laced Let melace them up with one of my nice new laces. Snowdrop did not dream ofany mischief so she stood before the old woman but she set to workso nimbly and pulled the lace so tight that Snowdrops breath wasstopped and she fell down as if she were dead. Theres an end to allthy beauty said the spiteful queen and went away home.In the evening the seven dwarfs came home and I need not say howgrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon theground as if she was quite dead. However they lifted her up and whenthey found what ailed her they cut the lace and in a little time shebegan to breathe and very soon came to life again. Then they said Theold woman was the queen herself take care another time and let no onein when we are away.When the queen got home she went straight to her glass and spoke to itas before but to her great grief it still said Thou queen art the fairest in all this land  But over the hills in the greenwood shade  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made  There Snowdrop is hiding her head and she  Is lovelier far O queen than thee.Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to see thatSnowdrop still lived and she dressed herself up again but in quiteanother dress from the one she wore before and took with her a poisonedcomb. When she reached the dwarfs cottage she knocked at the door andcried Fine wares to sell But Snowdrop said I dare not let anyonein. Then the queen said Only look at my beautiful combs and gaveher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty that she took it up andput it into her hair to try it but the moment it touched her headthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. There you maylie said the queen and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfscame in very early that evening and when they saw Snowdrop lying onthe ground they thought what had happened and soon found the poisonedcomb. And when they took it away she got well and told them all thathad passed and they warned her once more not to open the door toanyone.Meantime the queen went home to her glass and shook with rage when sheread the very same answer as before and she said Snowdrop shall dieif it cost me my life. So she went by herself into her chamber and gotready a poisoned apple the outside looked very rosy and tempting butwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as apeasants wife and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs cottageand knocked at the door but Snowdrop put her head out of the window andsaid I dare not let anyone in for the dwarfs have told me not. Doas you please said the old woman but at any rate take this prettyapple I will give it you. No said Snowdrop I dare not take it.You silly girl answered the other what are you afraid of Do youthink it is poisoned Come do you eat one part and I will eat theother. Now the apple was so made up that one side was good though theother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste forthe apple looked so very nice and when she saw the old woman eat shecould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouthwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. This time nothing will savethee said the queen and she went home to her glass and at last itsaid Thou queen art the fairest of all the fair.And then her wicked heart was glad and as happy as such a heart couldbe.When evening came and the dwarfs had gone home they found Snowdroplying on the ground no breath came from her lips and they were afraidthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up and combed her hair andwashed her face with wine and water but all was in vain for the littlegirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier and all sevenwatched and bewailed her three whole days and then they thought theywould bury her but her cheeks were still rosy and her face looked justas it did while she was alive so they said We will never bury her inthe cold ground. And they made a coffin of glass so that they mightstill look at her and wrote upon it in golden letters what her namewas and that she was a kings daughter. And the coffin was set amongthe hills and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And thebirds of the air came too and bemoaned Snowdrop and first of all camean owl and then a raven and at last a dove and sat by her side.And thus Snowdrop lay for a long long time and still only looked asthough she was asleep for she was even now as white as snow and as redas blood and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at thedwarfs house and he saw Snowdrop and read what was written in goldenletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money and prayed and besought themto let him take her away but they said We will not part with her forall the gold in the world. At last however they had pity on him andgave him the coffin but the moment he lifted it up to carry it homewith him the piece of apple fell from between her lips and Snowdropawoke and said Where am I And the prince said Thou art quite safewith me.Then he told her all that had happened and said I love you far betterthan all the world so come with me to my fathers palace and you shallbe my wife. And Snowdrop consented and went home with the princeand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for theirwedding.To the feast was asked among the rest Snowdrops old enemy the queenand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes she looked in theglass and said Tell me glass tell me true  Of all the ladies in the land  Who is fairest tell me whoAnd the glass answered Thou lady art loveliest here I ween  But lovelier far is the newmade queen.When she heard this she started with rage but her envy and curiositywere so great that she could not help setting out to see the bride. Andwhen she got there and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop who asshe thought had been dead a long while she choked with rage and felldown and died but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happilyover that land many many years and sometimes they went up into themountains and paid a visit to the little dwarfs who had been so kindto Snowdrop in her time of need.THE PINKThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven tobestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to herand said Be at rest you shall have a son with the power of wishingso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for that shall he have. Thenshe went to the king and told him the joyful tidings and when the timewas come she gave birth to a son and the king was filled with gladness.Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wildbeasts were kept and washed herself there in a clear stream. Ithappened once when the child was a little older that it was lying inher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook who knew that thechild had the power of wishing and stole it away and he took a henand cut it in pieces and dropped some of its blood on the queens apronand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret placewhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it and he ran to the king andaccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her bythe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron he believedthis fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be builtin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put intoit and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meator drink and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in theshape of white doves which flew to her twice a day and carried herfood until the seven years were over.The cook however thought to himself If the child has the power ofwishing and I am here he might very easily get me into trouble. Sohe left the palace and went to the boy who was already big enough tospeak and said to him Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself witha garden and all else that pertains to it. Scarcely were the words outof the boys mouth when everything was there that he had wished for.After a while the cook said to him It is not well for you to be soalone wish for a pretty girl as a companion. Then the kings sonwished for one and she immediately stood before him and was morebeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two playedtogether and loved each other with all their hearts and the old cookwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him howeverthat the kings son might some day wish to be with his father and thusbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden asideand said Tonight when the boy is asleep go to his bed and plunge thisknife into his heart and bring me his heart and tongue and if you donot do it you shall lose your life. Thereupon he went away and whenhe returned next day she had not done it and said Why should I shedthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone The cook oncemore said If you do not do it it shall cost you your own life. Whenhe had gone away she had a little hind brought to her and ordered herto be killed and took her heart and tongue and laid them on a plateand when she saw the old man coming she said to the boy Lie down inyour bed and draw the clothes over you. Then the wicked wretch came inand said Where are the boys heart and tongue The girl reached theplate to him but the kings son threw off the quilt and said You oldsinner why did you want to kill me Now will I pronounce thy sentence.You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neckand shall eat burning coals till the flames burst forth from yourthroat. And when he had spoken these words the old man was changedinto a poodle dog and had a gold collar round his neck and the cookswere ordered to bring up some live coals and these he ate until theflames broke forth from his throat. The kings son remained there ashort while longer and he thought of his mother and wondered if shewere still alive. At length he said to the maiden I will go home to myown country if you will go with me I will provide for you. Ahshe replied the way is so long and what shall I do in a strange landwhere I am unknown As she did not seem quite willing and as theycould not be parted from each other he wished that she might be changedinto a beautiful pink and took her with him. Then he went away to hisown country and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the towerin which his mother was confined and as it was so high he wished fora ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up andlooked inside and cried Beloved mother Lady Queen are you stillalive or are you dead She answered I have just eaten and am stillsatisfied for she thought the angels were there. Said he I am yourdear son whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your armsbut I am alive still and will soon set you free. Then he descendedagain and went to his father and caused himself to be announced as astrange huntsman and asked if he could offer him service. The king saidyes if he was skilful and could get game for him he should come tohim but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of thedistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much gamefor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned allthe huntsmen together and bade them go out into the forest with him.And he went with them and made them form a great circle open at one endwhere he stationed himself and began to wish. Two hundred deer and morecame running inside the circle at once and the huntsmen shot them.Then they were all placed on sixty country carts and driven home to theking and for once he was able to deck his table with game after havinghad none at all for years.Now the king felt great joy at this and commanded that his entirehousehold should eat with him next day and made a great feast. Whenthey were all assembled together he said to the huntsman As you areso clever you shall sit by me. He replied Lord King your majestymust excuse me I am a poor huntsman. But the king insisted on itand said You shall sit by me until he did it. Whilst he was sittingthere he thought of his dearest mother and wished that one of thekings principal servants would begin to speak of her and would ask howit was faring with the queen in the tower and if she were alive stillor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal beganand said Your majesty we live joyously here but how is the queenliving in the tower Is she still alive or has she died But the kingreplied She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts I willnot have her named. Then the huntsman arose and said Gracious lordfather she is alive still and I am her son and I was not carried awayby wild beasts but by that wretch the old cook who tore me from herarms when she was asleep and sprinkled her apron with the blood of achicken. Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar and saidThat is the wretch and caused live coals to be brought and these thedog was compelled to devour before the sight of all until flames burstforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he wouldlike to see the dog in his true shape and wished him back into the formof the cook in which he stood immediately with his white apronand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passionand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsmanspoke further and said Father will you see the maiden who brought meup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me but did not do itthough her own life depended on it The king replied Yes I wouldlike to see her. The son said Most gracious father I will show herto you in the form of a beautiful flower and he thrust his hand intohis pocket and brought forth the pink and placed it on the royal tableand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.Then the son said Now will I show her to you in her own form andwished that she might become a maiden and she stood there looking sobeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.And the king sent two waitingmaids and two attendants into the towerto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she wasled in she ate nothing and said The gracious and merciful God who hassupported me in the tower will soon set me free. She lived three daysmore and then died happily and when she was buried the two whitedoves which had brought her food to the tower and were angels ofheaven followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The agedking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces but grief consumed thekings own heart and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maidenwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket and whether theyare still alive or not is known to God.CLEVER ELSIEThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. Andwhen she had grown up her father said We will get her married. Yessaid the mother if only someone would come who would have her. Atlength a man came from a distance and wooed her who was called Hansbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. Oh saidthe father she has plenty of good sense and the mother said Ohshe can see the wind coming up the street and hear the flies coughing.Well said Hans if she is not really smart I wont have her. Whenthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten the mother said Elsie gointo the cellar and fetch some beer. Then Clever Elsie took the pitcherfrom the wall went into the cellar and tapped the lid briskly as shewent so that the time might not appear long. When she was below shefetched herself a chair and set it before the barrel so that she hadno need to stoop and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpectedinjury. Then she placed the can before her and turned the tap andwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle butlooked up at the wall and after much peering here and there saw apickaxe exactly above her which the masons had accidentally leftthere.Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said If I get Hans and we havea child and he grows big and we send him into the cellar here to drawbeer then the pickaxe will fall on his head and kill him. Then shesat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body over themisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drinkbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servantJust go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is. The maid went andfound her sitting in front of the barrel screaming loudly. Elsie whydo you weep asked the maid. Ah she answered have I not reason toweep If I get Hans and we have a child and he grows big and has todraw beer here the pickaxe will perhaps fall on his head and killhim. Then said the maid What a clever Elsie we have and sat downbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a whileas the maid did not come back and those upstairs were thirsty for thebeer the man said to the boy Just go down into the cellar and seewhere Elsie and the girl are. The boy went down and there sat CleverElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked Why are youweeping Ah said Elsie have I not reason to weep If I get Hansand we have a child and he grows big and has to draw beer here thepickaxe will fall on his head and kill him. Then said the boy Whata clever Elsie we have and sat down by her and likewise began tohowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy but as he still did notreturn the man said to the woman Just go down into the cellar and seewhere Elsie is The woman went down and found all three in the midstof their lamentations and inquired what was the cause then Elsie toldher also that her future child was to be killed by the pickaxe when itgrew big and had to draw beer and the pickaxe fell down. Then said themother likewise What a clever Elsie we have and sat down and weptwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time but as his wife did notcome back and his thirst grew ever greater he said I must go into thecellar myself and see where Elsie is. But when he got into the cellarand they were all sitting together crying and he heard the reason andthat Elsies child was the cause and the Elsie might perhaps bring oneinto the world some day and that he might be killed by the pickaxe ifhe should happen to be sitting beneath it drawing beer just at the verytime when it fell down he cried Oh what a clever Elsie and satdown and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alonefor a long time then as no one would come back he thought They must bewaiting for me below I too must go there and see what they are about.When he got down the five of them were sitting screaming and lamentingquite piteously each outdoing the other. What misfortune has happenedthen asked he. Ah dear Hans said Elsie if we marry each otherand have a child and he is big and we perhaps send him here to drawsomething to drink then the pickaxe which has been left up there mightdash his brains out if it were to fall down so have we not reason toweep Come said Hans more understanding than that is not neededfor my household as you are such a clever Elsie I will have you andseized her hand took her upstairs with him and married her.After Hans had had her some time he said Wife I am going out to workand earn some money for us go into the field and cut the corn that wemay have some bread. Yes dear Hans I will do that. After Hans hadgone away she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the fieldwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself What shall Ido shall I cut first or shall I eat first Oh I will eat first. Thenshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied she oncemore said What shall I do Shall I cut first or shall I sleep firstI will sleep first. Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.Hans had been at home for a long time but Elsie did not come then saidhe What a clever Elsie I have she is so industrious that she does noteven come home to eat. But when evening came and she still stayed awayHans went out to see what she had cut but nothing was cut and shewas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and broughta fowlers net with little bells and hung it round about her and shestill went on sleeping. Then he ran home shut the housedoor and satdown in his chair and worked. At length when it was quite dark CleverElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round abouther and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she wasalarmed and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie ornot and said Is it I or is it not I But she knew not what answerto make to this and stood for a time in doubt at length she thoughtI will go home and ask if it be I or if it be not I they will be sureto know. She ran to the door of her own house but it was shut thenshe knocked at the window and cried Hans is Elsie within Yesanswered Hans she is within. Hereupon she was terrified and saidAh heavens Then it is not I and went to another door but when thepeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it and shecould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village and no one hasseen her since.THE MISER IN THE BUSHA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant who had worked hard forhim three years without having been paid any wages. At last it cameinto the mans head that he would not go on thus without pay any longerso he went to his master and said I have worked hard for you a longtime I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for mytrouble. The farmer was a sad miser and knew that his man was verysimplehearted so he took out threepence and gave him for every yearsservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money tohave and said to himself Why should I work hard and live here on badfare any longer I can now travel into the wide world and make myselfmerry. With that he put his money into his purse and set out roamingover hill and valley.As he jogged along over the fields singing and dancing a little dwarfmet him and asked him what made him so merry. Why what should makeme downhearted said he I am sound in health and rich in purse whatshould I care for I have saved up my three years earnings and have itall safe in my pocket. How much may it come to said the little man.Full threepence replied the countryman. I wish you would give themto me said the other I am very poor. Then the man pitied him andgave him all he had and the little dwarf said in return As you havesuch a kind honest heart I will grant you three wishesone for everypenny so choose whatever you like. Then the countryman rejoiced athis good luck and said I like many things better than money first Iwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at secondlya fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it andthirdly I should like that everyone should grant what I ask. The dwarfsaid he should have his three wishes so he gave him the bow and fiddleand went his way.Our honest friend journeyed on his way too and if he was merry beforehe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an oldmiser close by them stood a tree and on the topmost twig sat a thrushsinging away most joyfully. Oh what a pretty bird said the miser Iwould give a great deal of money to have such a one. If thats allsaid the countryman I will soon bring it down. Then he took up hisbow and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.The miser crept into the bush to find it but directly he had got intothe middle his companion took up his fiddle and played away and themiser began to dance and spring about capering higher and higher inthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hungin rags about him and he himself was all scratched and wounded so thatthe blood ran down. Oh for heavens sake cried the miser Mastermaster pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve thisThou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough said the other thouart only meeting thy reward so he played up another tune. Then themiser began to beg and promise and offered money for his liberty buthe did not come up to the musicians price for some time and he dancedhim along brisker and brisker and the miser bid higher and higher tillat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purseand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countrymansaw so much money he said I will agree to your proposal. So he tookthe purse put up his fiddle and travelled on very pleased with hisbargain.Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush halfnaked and in a piteousplight and began to ponder how he should take his revenge and servehis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge andcomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money and beaten himinto the bargain and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at hisback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out hisofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him and hewas soon caught and brought up to be tried.The miser began to tell his tale and said he had been robbed ofhis money. No you gave it me for playing a tune to you. said thecountryman but the judge told him that was not likely and cut thematter short by ordering him off to the gallows.So away he was taken but as he stood on the steps he said My LordJudge grant me one last request. Anything but thy life replied theother. No said he I do not ask my life only to let me play uponmy fiddle for the last time. The miser cried out Oh no no forheavens sake dont listen to him dont listen to him But the judgesaid It is only this once he will soon have done. The fact was hecould not refuse the request on account of the dwarfs third gift.Then the miser said Bind me fast bind me fast for pitys sake. Butthe countryman seized his fiddle and struck up a tune and at the firstnote judge clerks and jailer were in motion all began capering andno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let hisprisoner go and danced also and by the time he had played the firstbar of the tune all were dancing togetherjudge court and miser andall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merryand pleasant enough but when it had gone on a while and there seemedto be no end of playing or dancing they began to cry out and beg himto leave off but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreatiestill the judge not only gave him his life but promised to return himthe hundred florins.Then he called to the miser and said Tell us now you vagabond whereyou got that gold or I shall play on for your amusement only I stoleit said the miser in the presence of all the people I acknowledgethat I stole it and that you earned it fairly. Then the countrymanstopped his fiddle and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.ASHPUTTELThe wife of a rich man fell sick and when she felt that her end drewnigh she called her only daughter to her bedside and said Always bea good girl and I will look down from heaven and watch over you. Soonafterwards she shut her eyes and died and was buried in the gardenand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept and was alwaysgood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautifulwhite covering over the grave but by the time the spring came and thesun had melted it away again her father had married another wife. Thisnew wife had two daughters of her own that she brought home with herthey were fair in face but foul at heart and it was now a sorry timefor the poor little girl. What does the goodfornothing want in theparlour said they they who would eat bread should first earn itaway with the kitchenmaid Then they took away her fine clothes andgave her an old grey frock to put on and laughed at her and turned herinto the kitchen.There she was forced to do hard work to rise early before daylight tobring the water to make the fire to cook and to wash. Besides thatthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways and laughed at her. In theevening when she was tired she had no bed to lie down on but was madeto lie by the hearth among the ashes and as this of course made heralways dusty and dirty they called her Ashputtel.It happened once that the father was going to the fair and asked hiswifes daughters what he should bring them. Fine clothes said thefirst Pearls and diamonds cried the second. Now child said heto his own daughter what will you have The first twig dearfather that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to comehomewards said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothesand pearls and diamonds they had asked for and on his way home as herode through a green copse a hazel twig brushed against him and almostpushed off his hat so he broke it off and brought it away and when hegot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it and went toher mothers grave and planted it there and cried so much that it waswatered with her tears and there it grew and became a fine tree. Threetimes every day she went to it and cried and soon a little bird cameand built its nest upon the tree and talked with her and watched overher and brought her whatever she wished for.Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast which was tolast three days and out of those who came to it his son was to choosea bride for himself. Ashputtels two sisters were asked to come so theycalled her up and said Now comb our hair brush our shoes and tieour sashes for us for we are going to dance at the kings feast.Then she did as she was told but when all was done she could not helpcrying for she thought to herself she should so have liked to havegone with them to the ball and at last she begged her mother very hardto let her go. You Ashputtel said she you who have nothing towear no clothes at all and who cannot even danceyou want to go tothe ball And when she kept on begging she said at last to get rid ofher I will throw this dishful of peas into the ashheap and if intwo hours time you have picked them all out you shall go to the feasttoo.Then she threw the peas down among the ashes but the little maiden ranout at the back door into the garden and cried out Hither hither through the sky  Turtledoves and linnets fly  Blackbird thrush and chaffinch gay  Hither hither haste away  One and all come help me quick  Haste ye haste yepick pick pickThen first came two white doves flying in at the kitchen window nextcame two turtledoves and after them came all the little birds underheaven chirping and fluttering in and they flew down into the ashes.And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work pickpick pick and then the others began to pick pick pick and amongthem all they soon picked out all the good grain and put it into a dishbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quitedone and all flew out again at the windows.Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother overjoyed at the thoughtthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said No no youslut you have no clothes and cannot dance you shall not go. And whenAshputtel begged very hard to go she said If you can in one hourstime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes you shall gotoo. And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So sheshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the houseand cried out as before Hither hither through the sky  Turtledoves and linnets fly  Blackbird thrush and chaffinch gay  Hither hither haste away  One and all come help me quick  Haste ye haste yepick pick pickThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window next came twoturtledoves and after them came all the little birds under heavenchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes and thelittle doves put their heads down and set to work pick pick pick andthen the others began pick pick pick and they put all the good graininto the dishes and left all the ashes. Before half an hours time allwas done and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes toher mother rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.But her mother said It is all of no use you cannot go you have noclothes and cannot dance and you would only put us to shame and offshe went with her two daughters to the ball.Now when all were gone and nobody left at home Ashputtel wentsorrowfully and sat down under the hazeltree and cried out Shake shake hazeltree  Gold and silver over meThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold andsilver dress for her and slippers of spangled silk and she put themon and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know herand thought it must be some strange princess she looked so fine andbeautiful in her rich clothes and they never once thought of Ashputteltaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.The kings son soon came up to her and took her by the hand and dancedwith her and no one else and he never left her hand but when anyoneelse came to ask her to dance he said This lady is dancing with me.Thus they danced till a late hour of the night and then she wanted togo home and the kings son said I shall go and take care of you toyour home for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. Butshe slipped away from him unawares and ran off towards home and asthe prince followed her she jumped up into the pigeonhouse and shutthe door. Then he waited till her father came home and told him thatthe unknown maiden who had been at the feast had hid herself in thepigeonhouse. But when they had broken open the door they found no onewithin and as they came back into the house Ashputtel was lying asshe always did in her dirty frock by the ashes and her dim littlelamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she couldthrough the pigeonhouse and on to the hazeltree and had there takenoff her beautiful clothes and put them beneath the tree that the birdmight carry them away and had lain down again amid the ashes in herlittle grey frock.The next day when the feast was again held and her father mother andsisters were gone Ashputtel went to the hazeltree and said Shake shake hazeltree  Gold and silver over meAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one shehad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball everyonewondered at her beauty but the kings son who was waiting for hertook her by the hand and danced with her and when anyone asked her todance he said as before This lady is dancing with me.When night came she wanted to go home and the kings son followed hereas before that he might see into what house she went but she sprangaway from him all at once into the garden behind her fathers house.In this garden stood a fine large peartree full of ripe fruit andAshputtel not knowing where to hide herself jumped up into it withoutbeing seen. Then the kings son lost sight of her and could not findout where she was gone but waited till her father came home and saidto him The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away and Ithink she must have sprung into the peartree. The father thought tohimself Can it be Ashputtel So he had an axe brought and they cutdown the tree but found no one upon it. And when they came back intothe kitchen there lay Ashputtel among the ashes for she had slippeddown on the other side of the tree and carried her beautiful clothesback to the bird at the hazeltree and then put on her little greyfrock.The third day when her father and mother and sisters were gone shewent again into the garden and said Shake shake hazeltree  Gold and silver over meThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than theformer one and slippers which were all of gold so that when she cameto the feast no one knew what to say for wonder at her beauty and thekings son danced with nobody but her and when anyone else asked her todance he said This lady is my partner sir.When night came she wanted to go home and the kings son would go withher and said to himself I will not lose her this time but howevershe again slipped away from him though in such a hurry that she droppedher left golden slipper upon the stairs.The prince took the shoe and went the next day to the king his fatherand said I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipperfits. Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it for theyhad beautiful feet and had no doubt that they could wear the goldenslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was andwanted to try it on and the mother stood by. But her great toe couldnot go into it and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Thenthe mother gave her a knife and said Never mind cut it off when youare queen you will not care about toes you will not want to walk. Sothe silly girl cut off her great toe and thus squeezed on the shoeand went to the kings son. Then he took her for his bride and set herbeside him on his horse and rode away with her homewards.But on their way home they had to pass by the hazeltree that Ashputtelhad planted and on the branch sat a little dove singing Back again back again look to the shoe  The shoe is too small and not made for you  Prince prince look again for thy bride  For shes not the true one that sits by thy side.Then the prince got down and looked at her foot and he saw by theblood that streamed from it what a trick she had played him. So heturned his horse round and brought the false bride back to her homeand said This is not the right bride let the other sister try and puton the slipper. Then she went into the room and got her foot into theshoe all but the heel which was too large. But her mother squeezed itin till the blood came and took her to the kings son and he set heras his bride by his side on his horse and rode away with her.But when they came to the hazeltree the little dove sat there stilland sang Back again back again look to the shoe  The shoe is too small and not made for you  Prince prince look again for thy bride  For shes not the true one that sits by thy side.Then he looked down and saw that the blood streamed so much from theshoe that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horseand brought her also back again. This is not the true bride said heto the father have you no other daughters No said he there isonly a little dirty Ashputtel here the child of my first wife I amsure she cannot be the bride. The prince told him to send her. But themother said No no she is much too dirty she will not dare to showherself. However the prince would have her come and she first washedher face and hands and then went in and curtsied to him and he reachedher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left footand put on the golden slipper and it fitted her as if it had been madefor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her andsaid This is the right bride. But the mother and both the sisterswere frightened and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on hishorse and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazeltree thewhite dove sang Home home look at the shoe  Princess the shoe was made for you  Prince prince take home thy bride  For she is the true one that sits by thy sideAnd when the dove had done its song it came flying and perched uponher right shoulder and so went home with her.THE WHITE SNAKEA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom throughall the land. Nothing was hidden from him and it seemed as if news ofthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had astrange custom every day after dinner when the table was clearedand no one else was present a trusty servant had to bring him one moredish. It was covered however and even the servant did not know whatwas in it neither did anyone know for the king never took off thecover to eat of it until he was quite alone.This had gone on for a long time when one day the servant who tookaway the dish was overcome with such curiosity that he could not helpcarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the doorhe lifted up the cover and saw a white snake lying on the dish. Butwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting itso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had ittouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voicesoutside his window. He went and listened and then noticed that it wasthe sparrows who were chattering together and telling one another ofall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eatingthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her mostbeautiful ring and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trustyservant who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man tobe brought before him and threatened with angry words that unless hecould before the morrow point out the thief he himself should be lookedupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence he wasdismissed with no better answer.In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thoughthow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sittingtogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest and whilst theywere making their feathers smooth with their bills they were having aconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.They were telling one another of all the places where they had beenwaddling about all the morning and what good food they had found andone said in a pitiful tone Something lies heavy on my stomach asI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queenswindow. The servant at once seized her by the neck carried her to thekitchen and said to the cook Here is a fine duck pray kill her.Yes said the cook and weighed her in his hand she has sparedno trouble to fatten herself and has been waiting to be roasted longenough. So he cut off her head and as she was being dressed for thespit the queens ring was found inside her.The servant could now easily prove his innocence and the king to makeamends for the wrong allowed him to ask a favour and promised himthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refusedeverything and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling ashe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his requestwas granted he set out on his way and one day came to a pond where hesaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now thoughit is said that fishes are dumb he heard them lamenting that they mustperish so miserably and as he had a kind heart he got off hishorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt withdelight put out their heads and cried to him We will remember youand repay you for saving usHe rode on and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice inthe sand at his feet. He listened and heard an antking complain Whycannot folks with their clumsy beasts keep off our bodies That stupidhorse with his heavy hoofs has been treading down my people withoutmercy So he turned on to a side path and the antking cried out tohim We will remember youone good turn deserves anotherThe path led him into a wood and there he saw two old ravens standingby their nest and throwing out their young ones. Out with you youidle goodfornothing creatures cried they we cannot find food foryou any longer you are big enough and can provide for yourselves.But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground flapping their wings andcrying Oh what helpless chicks we are We must shift for ourselvesand yet we cannot fly What can we do but lie here and starve So thegood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword and gaveit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it satisfied theirhunger and cried We will remember youone good turn deservesanotherAnd now he had to use his own legs and when he had walked a longway he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd inthe streets and a man rode up on horseback crying aloud The kingsdaughter wants a husband but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hardtask and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life. Many hadalready made the attempt but in vain nevertheless when the youthsaw the kings daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that heforgot all danger went before the king and declared himself a suitor.So he was led out to the sea and a gold ring was thrown into it beforehis eyes then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from thebottom of the sea and added If you come up again without it you willbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves. All thepeople grieved for the handsome youth then they went away leaving himalone by the sea.He stood on the shore and considered what he should do when suddenlyhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him and they were the veryfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel inits mouth which it laid on the shore at the youths feet and when hehad taken it up and opened it there lay the gold ring in the shell.Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant himthe promised reward.But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal inbirth she scorned him and required him first to perform anothertask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands tensacksful of milletseed on the grass then she said Tomorrow morningbefore sunrise these must be picked up and not a single grain bewanting.The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possibleto perform this task but he could think of nothing and there he satsorrowfully awaiting the break of day when he should be led to death.But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he sawall the ten sacks standing side by side quite full and not a singlegrain was missing. The antking had come in the night with thousandsand thousands of ants and the grateful creatures had by great industrypicked up all the milletseed and gathered them into the sacks.Presently the kings daughter herself came down into the garden and wasamazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.But she could not yet conquer her proud heart and said Although hehas performed both the tasks he shall not be my husband until he hadbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life. The youth did not know wherethe Tree of Life stood but he set out and would have gone on for everas long as his legs would carry him though he had no hope of findingit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms he came one evening toa wood and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling inthe branches and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same timethree ravens flew down to him perched themselves upon his knee andsaid We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving whenwe had grown big and heard that you were seeking the Golden Applewe flew over the sea to the end of the world where the Tree of Lifestands and have brought you the apple. The youth full of joy set outhomewards and took the Golden Apple to the kings beautiful daughterwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life intwo and ate it together and then her heart became full of love for himand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDSThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids andloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day shewanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called allseven to her and said Dear children I have to go into the forestbe on your guard against the wolf if he comes in he will devour youallskin hair and everything. The wretch often disguises himself butyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet. Thekids said Dear mother we will take good care of ourselves you may goaway without any anxiety. Then the old one bleated and went on her waywith an easy mind.It was not long before someone knocked at the housedoor and calledOpen the door dear children your mother is here and has broughtsomething back with her for each of you. But the little kids knew thatit was the wolf by the rough voice. We will not open the door criedthey you are not our mother. She has a soft pleasant voice butyour voice is rough you are the wolf Then the wolf went away to ashopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk ate this and madehis voice soft with it. Then he came back knocked at the door of thehouse and called Open the door dear children your mother is hereand has brought something back with her for each of you. But the wolfhad laid his black paws against the window and the children saw themand cried We will not open the door our mother has not black feetlike you you are the wolf Then the wolf ran to a baker and said Ihave hurt my feet rub some dough over them for me. And when the bakerhad rubbed his feet over he ran to the miller and said Strew somewhite meal over my feet for me. The miller thought to himself Thewolf wants to deceive someone and refused but the wolf said If youwill not do it I will devour you. Then the miller was afraid and madehis paws white for him. Truly this is the way of mankind.So now the wretch went for the third time to the housedoor knocked atit and said Open the door for me children your dear little motherhas come home and has brought every one of you something back from theforest with her. The little kids cried First show us your paws thatwe may know if you are our dear little mother. Then he put his pawsin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white theybelieved that all he said was true and opened the door. But who shouldcome in but the wolf They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.One sprang under the table the second into the bed the third into thestove the fourth into the kitchen the fifth into the cupboard thesixth under the washingbowl and the seventh into the clockcase. Butthe wolf found them all and used no great ceremony one after theother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest who was inthe clockcase was the only one he did not find. When the wolf hadsatisfied his appetite he took himself off laid himself down under atree in the green meadow outside and began to sleep. Soon afterwardsthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah what a sight she sawthere The housedoor stood wide open. The table chairs and bencheswere thrown down the washingbowl lay broken to pieces and the quiltsand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children but theywere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name butno one answered. At last when she came to the youngest a soft voicecried Dear mother I am in the clockcase. She took the kid out andit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Thenyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.At length in her grief she went out and the youngest kid ran with her.When they came to the meadow there lay the wolf by the tree and snoredso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side andsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. Ahheavens she said is it possible that my poor children whom he hasswallowed down for his supper can be still alive Then the kid had torun home and fetch scissors and a needle and thread and the goat cutopen the monsters stomach and hardly had she made one cut than onelittle kid thrust its head out and when she had cut farther all sixsprang out one after another and were all still alive and had sufferedno injury whatever for in his greediness the monster had swallowed themdown whole. What rejoicing there was They embraced their dear motherand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother however said Nowgo and look for some big stones and we will fill the wicked beastsstomach with them while he is still asleep. Then the seven kids draggedthe stones thither with all speed and put as many of them into thisstomach as they could get in and the mother sewed him up again in thegreatest haste so that he was not aware of anything and never oncestirred.When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep he got on his legsand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty he wanted togo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about thestones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then criedhe What rumbles and tumbles  Against my poor bones  I thought twas six kids  But it feels like big stones.And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink theheavy stones made him fall in and he drowned miserably. When the sevenkids saw that they came running to the spot and cried aloud The wolfis dead The wolf is dead and danced for joy round about the well withtheir mother.THE QUEEN BEETwo kings sons once upon a time went into the world to seek theirfortunes but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living sothat they could not return home again. Then their brother who was alittle insignificant dwarf went out to seek for his brothers but whenhe had found them they only laughed at him to think that he who was soyoung and simple should try to travel through the world when they whowere so much wiser had been unable to get on. However they all setout on their journey together and came at last to an anthill. The twoelder brothers would have pulled it down in order to see how the poorants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But thelittle dwarf said Let the poor things enjoy themselves I will notsuffer you to trouble them.So on they went and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimmingabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two and roast them. But thedwarf said Let the poor things enjoy themselves you shall not killthem. Next they came to a beesnest in a hollow tree and there wasso much honey that it ran down the trunk and the two brothers wanted tolight a fire under the tree and kill the bees so as to get their honey.But the dwarf held them back and said Let the pretty insects enjoythemselves I cannot let you burn them.At length the three brothers came to a castle and as they passed by thestables they saw fine horses standing there but all were of marble andno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms till theycame to a door on which were three locks but in the middle of the doorwas a wicket so that they could look into the next room. There they sawa little grey old man sitting at a table and they called to him once ortwice but he did not hear however they called a third time and thenhe rose and came out to them.He said nothing but took hold of them and led them to a beautifultable covered with all sorts of good things and when they had eaten anddrunk he showed each of them to a bedchamber.The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble tablewhere there were three tablets containing an account of the means bywhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said In thewood under the moss lie the thousand pearls belonging to the kingsdaughter they must all be found and if one be missing by set of sunhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.The eldest brother set out and sought for the pearls the whole daybut the evening came and he had not found the first hundred so he wasturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.The next day the second brother undertook the task but he succeeded nobetter than the first for he could only find the second hundred of thepearls and therefore he too was turned into stone.At last came the little dwarfs turn and he looked in the moss but itwas so hard to find the pearls and the job was so tiresomeso he satdown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there the king of the antswhose life he had saved came to help him with five thousand ants andit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in aheap.The second tablet said The key of the princesss bedchamber must befished up out of the lake. And as the dwarf came to the brink of ithe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about and theydived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest andthe best of the kings three daughters. Now they were all beautiful andall exactly alike but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece ofsugar the next some sweet syrup and the youngest a spoonful of honeyso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.Then came the queen of the bees who had been saved by the little dwarffrom the fire and she tried the lips of all three but at last she satupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey and so the dwarf knewwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken and all who had beenturned into stones awoke and took their proper forms. And the dwarfmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses and was king afterher fathers death but his two brothers married the other two sisters.THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKERThere was once a shoemaker who worked very hard and was very honestbut still he could not earn enough to live upon and at last all hehad in the world was gone save just leather enough to make one pair ofshoes.Then he cut his leather out all ready to make up the next day meaningto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear andhis heart light amidst all his troubles so he went peaceably to bedleft all his cares to Heaven and soon fell asleep. In the morning afterhe had said his prayers he sat himself down to his work when to hisgreat wonder there stood the shoes all ready made upon the table. Thegood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.He looked at the workmanship there was not one false stitch in thewhole job all was so neat and true that it was quite a masterpiece.The same day a customer came in and the shoes suited him so well thathe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them and the poorshoemaker with the money bought leather enough to make two pairs more.In the evening he cut out the work and went to bed early that he mightget up and begin betimes next day but he was saved all the trouble forwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soonin came buyers who paid him handsomely for his goods so that he boughtleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnightand found it done in the morning as before and so it went on for sometime what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak andthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.One evening about Christmastime as he and his wife were sitting overthe fire chatting together he said to her I should like to sit up andwatch tonight that we may see who it is that comes and does my work forme. The wife liked the thought so they left a light burning and hidthemselves in a corner of the room behind a curtain that was hung upthere and watched what would happen.As soon as it was midnight there came in two little naked dwarfs andthey sat themselves upon the shoemakers bench took up all the workthat was cut out and began to ply with their little fingers stitchingand rapping and tapping away at such a rate that the shoemaker was allwonder and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went till thejob was quite done and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.This was long before daybreak and then they bustled away as quick aslightning.The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. These little wights havemade us rich and we ought to be thankful to them and do them a goodturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do andindeed it is not very decent for they have nothing upon their backs tokeep off the cold. Ill tell you what I will make each of them a shirtand a coat and waistcoat and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain anddo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.The thought pleased the good cobbler very much and one evening whenall the things were ready they laid them on the table instead of thework that they used to cut out and then went and hid themselves towatch what the little elves would do.About midnight in they came dancing and skipping hopped round theroom and then went to sit down to their work as usual but when theysaw the clothes lying for them they laughed and chuckled and seemedmightily delighted.Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye and danced andcapered and sprang about as merry as could be till at last they dancedout at the door and away over the green.The good couple saw them no more but everything went well with themfrom that time forward as long as they lived.THE JUNIPERTREELong long ago some two thousand years or so there lived a richman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly butsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desireto have one that the wife prayed for it day and night but still theyremained childless.In front of the house there was a court in which grew a junipertree.One winters day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples andas she was peeling them she cut her finger and the blood fell on thesnow. Ah sighed the woman heavily if I had but a child as red asblood and as white as snow and as she spoke the words her heart grewlight within her and it seemed to her that her wish was granted andshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passedand the snow had all disappeared then another month went by and allthe earth was green. So the months followed one another and first thetrees budded in the woods and soon the green branches grew thicklyintertwined and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wifestood under the junipertree and it was so full of sweet scent that herheart leaped for joy and she was so overcome with her happiness thatshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm andshe was glad and at peace but when they were fully ripe she picked theberries and ate eagerly of them and then she grew sad and ill. A littlewhile later she called her husband and said to him weeping. If Idie bury me under the junipertree. Then she felt comforted and happyagain and before another month had passed she had a little child andwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood her joywas so great that she died.Her husband buried her under the junipertree and wept bitterly forher. By degrees however his sorrow grew less and although at times hestill grieved over his loss he was able to go about as usual and lateron he married again.He now had a little daughter born to him the child of his first wifewas a boy who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The motherloved her daughter very much and when she looked at her and then lookedat the boy it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand inthe way of her own child and she was continually thinking how she couldget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possessionof her more and more and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. Shedrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings so that thepoor child went about in fear and had no peace from the time he leftschool to the time he went back.One day the little daughter came running to her mother in thestoreroom and said Mother give me an apple. Yes my child saidthe wife and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest the chesthad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.Mother said the little daughter again may not brother have onetoo The mother was angry at this but she answered Yes when hecomes out of school.Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming and it seemedas if an evil spirit entered into her for she snatched the apple outof her little daughters hand and said You shall not have one beforeyour brother. She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. Thelittle boy now came in and the evil spirit in the wife made her saykindly to him My son will you have an apple but she gave him awicked look. Mother said the boy how dreadful you look Yes giveme an apple. The thought came to her that she would kill him. Comewith me she said and she lifted up the lid of the chest take oneout for yourself. And as he bent over to do so the evil spirit urgedher and crash down went the lid and off went the little boys head.Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it she thought. Soshe went upstairs to her room and took a white handkerchief out ofher top drawer then she set the boys head again on his shoulders andbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen and placedhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.Soon after this little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirringa pot of boiling water over the fire and said Mother brother issitting by the door with an apple in his hand and he looks so paleand when I asked him to give me the apple he did not answer and thatfrightened me.Go to him again said her mother and if he does not answer give hima box on the ear. So little Marleen went and said Brother give methat apple but he did not say a word then she gave him a box on theear and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this that she rancrying and screaming to her mother. Oh she said I have knocked offbrothers head and then she wept and wept and nothing would stop her.What have you done said her mother but no one must know about itso you must keep silence what is done cant be undone we will makehim into puddings. And she took the little boy and cut him up made himinto puddings and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking onand wept and wept and her tears fell into the pot so that there was noneed of salt.Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner he askedWhere is my son The mother said nothing but gave him a large dish ofblack pudding and Marleen still wept without ceasing.The father again asked Where is my sonOh answered the wife he is gone into the country to his mothersgreat uncle he is going to stay there some time.What has he gone there for and he never even said goodbye to meWell he likes being there and he told me he should be away quite sixweeks he is well looked after there.I feel very unhappy about it said the husband in case it should notbe all right and he ought to have said goodbye to me.With this he went on with his dinner and said Little Marleen why doyou weep Brother will soon be back. Then he asked his wife for morepudding and as he ate he threw the bones under the table.Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out ofher bottom drawer and in it she wrapped all the bones from under thetable and carried them outside and all the time she did nothing butweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the junipertree andshe had no sooner done so then all her sadness seemed to leave herand she wept no more. And now the junipertree began to move and thebranches waved backwards and forwards first away from one another andthen together again as it might be someone clapping their hands forjoy. After this a mist came round the tree and in the midst of it therewas a burning as of fire and out of the fire there flew a beautifulbird that rose high into the air singing magnificently and when itcould no more be seen the junipertree stood there as before and thesilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother werestill alive and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully tothe table and ate.The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began tosing My mother killed her little son  My father grieved when I was gone  My sister loved me best of all  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the junipertree  Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am IThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain when he heard thesong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he gotup and ran out and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of hisslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street with a slipper onone foot and a sock on the other he still had on his apron and stillheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands and so he stood gazingup at the bird while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.Bird he said how beautifully you sing Sing me that song again.Nay said the bird I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that goldchain and I will sing it you again.Here is the chain take it said the goldsmith. Only sing me thatagain.The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw and thenhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang My mother killed her little son  My father grieved when I was gone  My sister loved me best of all  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the junipertree  Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am IThen he flew away and settled on the roof of a shoemakers house andsang My mother killed her little son  My father grieved when I was gone  My sister loved me best of all  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the junipertree  Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am IThe shoemaker heard him and he jumped up and ran out in hisshirtsleeves and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with hishand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.Bird he said how beautifully you sing Then he called through thedoor to his wife Wife come out here is a bird come and look at itand hear how beautifully it sings. Then he called his daughter and thechildren then the apprentices girls and boys and they all ran up thestreet to look at the bird and saw how splendid it was with its redand green feathers and its neck like burnished gold and eyes like twobright stars in its head.Bird said the shoemaker sing me that song again.Nay answered the bird I do not sing twice for nothing you mustgive me something.Wife said the man go into the garret on the upper shelf you willsee a pair of red shoes bring them to me. The wife went in and fetchedthe shoes.There bird said the shoemaker now sing me that song again.The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw and then hewent back to the roof and sang My mother killed her little son  My father grieved when I was gone  My sister loved me best of all  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the junipertree  Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am IWhen he had finished he flew away. He had the chain in his right clawand the shoes in his left and he flew right away to a mill and themill went Click clack click clack click clack. Inside the mill weretwenty of the millers men hewing a stone and as they went Hick hackhick hack hick hack the mill went Click clack click clack clickclack.The bird settled on a limetree in front of the mill and sang My mother killed her little sonthen one of the men left off  My father grieved when I was gonetwo more men left off and listened  My sister loved me best of allthen four more left off  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that they might lienow there were only eight at work  UnderneathAnd now only five  the junipertree.And now only one  Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am Ithen he looked up and the last one had left off work.Bird he said what a beautiful song that is you sing Let me hear ittoo sing it again.Nay answered the bird I do not sing twice for nothing give me thatmillstone and I will sing it again.If it belonged to me alone said the man you should have it.Yes yes said the others if he will sing again he can have it.The bird came down and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up thestone with a beam then the bird put his head through the hole and tookthe stone round his neck like a collar and flew back with it to thetree and sang My mother killed her little son  My father grieved when I was gone  My sister loved me best of all  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that they might lie  Underneath the junipertree  Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am IAnd when he had finished his song he spread his wings and with thechain in his right claw the shoes in his left and the millstone roundhis neck he flew right away to his fathers house.The father the mother and little Marleen were having their dinner.How lighthearted I feel said the father so pleased and cheerful.And I said the mother I feel so uneasy as if a heavy thunderstormwere coming.But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.I do feel so happy said the father and how beautifully the sunshines I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.Ah said the wife and I am so full of distress and uneasiness thatmy teeth chatter and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins andshe tore open her dress and all the while little Marleen sat in thecorner and wept and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.The bird now flew to the junipertree and began singing My mother killed her little sonthe mother shut her eyes and her ears that she might see and hearnothing but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of aviolent storm and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning  My father grieved when I was goneLook mother said the man at the beautiful bird that is singing somagnificently and how warm and bright the sun is and what a deliciousscent of spice in the air  My sister loved me best of allthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.I must go outside and see the bird nearer said the man.Ah do not go cried the wife.

My father grieved when I was gonethen the woman fell down again as if dead.  My sister loved me best of allWell said little Marleen I will go out too and see if the bird willgive me anything.So she went out.

The poor man thought he would try to better himself sopulling off his red coat he became a gardener and dug his ground welland sowed turnips.When the seed came up there was one plant bigger than all the rest andit kept getting larger and larger and seemed as if it would never ceasegrowing so that it might have been called the prince of turnips forthere never was such a one seen before and never will again. At last itwas so big that it filled a cart and two oxen could hardly draw it andthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it nor whether itwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself Whatshall I do with it if I sell it it will bring no more than anotherand for eating the little turnips are better than this the best thingperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.Then he yoked his oxen and drew the turnip to the court and gave itto the king. What a wonderful thing said the king I have seen manystrange things but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did youget the seed or is it only your good luck If so you are a true childof fortune. Ah no answered the gardener I am no child of fortuneI am a poor soldier who never could get enough to live upon so Ilaid aside my red coat and set to work tilling the ground. I have abrother who is rich and your majesty knows him well and all the worldknows him but because I am poor everybody forgets me.The king then took pity on him and said You shall be poor nolonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than yourbrother. Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks and made him sorich that his brothers fortune could not at all be compared with his.When the brother heard of all this and how a turnip had made thegardener so rich he envied him sorely and bethought himself how hecould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However hedetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother and got together arich present of gold and fine horses for the king and thought he musthave a much larger gift in return for if his brother had received somuch for only a turnip what must his present be worthThe king took the gift very graciously and said he knew not what togive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip sothe soldier was forced to put it into a cart and drag it home with him.When he reached home he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spiteand at length wicked thoughts came into his head and he resolved tokill his brother.So he hired some villains to murder him and having shown them where tolie in ambush he went to his brother and said Dear brother I havefound a hidden treasure let us go and dig it up and share it betweenus. The other had no suspicions of his roguery so they went outtogether and as they were travelling along the murderers rushed outupon him bound him and were going to hang him on a tree.But whilst they were getting all ready they heard the trampling of ahorse at a distance which so frightened them that they pushed theirprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack and swung him up by acord to the tree where they left him dangling and ran away. Meantimehe worked and worked away till he made a hole large enough to put outhis head.When the horseman came up he proved to be a student a merry fellowwho was journeying along on his nag and singing as he went. As soon asthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree he cried out Goodmorning good morning to thee my friend The student looked abouteverywhere and seeing no one and not knowing where the voice camefrom cried out Who calls meThen the man in the tree answered Lift up thine eyes for behold hereI sit in the sack of wisdom here have I in a short time learned greatand wondrous things. Compared to this seat all the learning of theschools is as empty air. A little longer and I shall know all that mancan know and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. HereI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars the lawsthat control the winds the number of the sands on the seashore thehealing of the sick the virtues of all simples of birds and ofprecious stones. Wert thou but once here my friend though wouldst feeland own the power of knowledge.The student listened to all this and wondered much at last he saidBlessed be the day and hour when I found you cannot you contrive tolet me into the sack for a little while Then the other answered as ifvery unwillingly A little space I may allow thee to sit here if thouwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly but thou must tarry yet anhour below till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknownto me.So the student sat himself down and waited a while but the time hungheavy upon him and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwithfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to giveway and said Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend by untyingyonder cord and then thou shalt enter. So the student let him downopened the sack and set him free. Now then cried he let me ascendquickly. As he began to put himself into the sack heels first Wait awhile said the gardener that is not the way. Then he pushed himin head first tied up the sack and soon swung up the searcher afterwisdom dangling in the air. How is it with thee friend said hedost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee Rest there in peacetill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.So saying he trotted off on the students nag and left the poor fellowto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.CLEVER HANSThe mother of Hans said Whither away Hans Hans answered ToGretel.

Then said the father Hark youmy son try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go fromhence I will give you into the care of a celebrated master who shallsee what he can do with you. The youth was sent into a strange townand remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this timehe came home again and his father asked Now my son what have youlearnt Father I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark. Lordhave mercy on us cried the father is that all you have learnt Iwill send you into another town to another master. The youth was takenthither and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came backthe father again asked My son what have you learnt He answeredFather I have learnt what the birds say. Then the father fell into arage and said Oh you lost man you have spent the precious time andlearnt nothing are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes I willsend you to a third master but if you learn nothing this time also Iwill no longer be your father. The youth remained a whole year with thethird master also and when he came home again and his father inquiredMy son what have you learnt he answered Dear father I have thisyear learnt what the frogs croak. Then the father fell into the mostfurious anger sprang up called his people thither and said This manis no longer my son I drive him forth and command you to take himout into the forest and kill him. They took him forth but when theyshould have killed him they could not do it for pity and let him goand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carrythem to the old man as a token.The youth wandered on and after some time came to a fortress where hebegged for a nights lodging. Yes said the lord of the castle ifyou will pass the night down there in the old tower go thither but Iwarn you it is at the peril of your life for it is full of wild dogswhich bark and howl without stopping and at certain hours a man has tobe given to them whom they at once devour. The whole district was insorrow and dismay because of them and yet no one could do anything tostop this. The youth however was without fear and said Just let mego down to the barking dogs and give me something that I can throw tothem they will do nothing to harm me. As he himself would have it sothey gave him some food for the wild animals and led him down to thetower. When he went inside the dogs did not bark at him but waggedtheir tails quite amicably around him ate what he set before them anddid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning to the astonishment ofeveryone he came out again safe and unharmed and said to the lord ofthe castle The dogs have revealed to me in their own language whythey dwell there and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched andare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the towerand they can have no rest until it is taken away and I have likewiselearnt from their discourse how that is to be done. Then all whoheard this rejoiced and the lord of the castle said he would adopt himas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again andas he knew what he had to do he did it thoroughly and brought a chestfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforthheard no more they had disappeared and the country was freed from thetrouble.After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. Onthe way he passed by a marsh in which a number of frogs were sittingcroaking. He listened to them and when he became aware of what theywere saying he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived inRome where the Pope had just died and there was great doubt amongthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They atlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should bedistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that wasdecided on the young count entered into the church and suddenly twosnowwhite doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. Theecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above and asked him onthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided and knew not if he wereworthy of this but the doves counselled him to do it and at length hesaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated and thus was fulfilledwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way which had so affected himthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass anddid not know one word of it but the two doves sat continually on hisshoulders and said it all in his ear.THE FOX AND THE CATIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest and as she thought toherself He is clever and full of experience and much esteemed in theworld she spoke to him in a friendly way. Good day dear Mr Foxhow are you How is all with you How are you getting on in these hardtimes The fox full of all kinds of arrogance looked at the cat fromhead to foot and for a long time did not know whether he would giveany answer or not. At last he said Oh you wretched beardcleaner youpiebald fool you hungry mousehunter what can you be thinking of Haveyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on What have you learnt Howmany arts do you understand I understand but one replied thecat modestly. What art is that asked the fox. When the hounds arefollowing me I can spring into a tree and save myself. Is that allsaid the fox. I am master of a hundred arts and have into the bargaina sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you come with me I willteach you how people get away from the hounds. Just then came a hunterwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree and sat down at the topof it where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. Open yoursack Mr Fox open your sack cried the cat to him but the dogs hadalready seized him and were holding him fast. Ah Mr Fox cried thecat. You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch Had you beenable to climb like me you would not have lost your life.THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERSDear children said a poor man to his four sons I have nothing togive you you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Beginby learning some craft or another and see how you can get on. So thefour brothers took their walkingsticks in their hands and their littlebundles on their shoulders and after bidding their father goodbye wentall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they cameto four crossways each leading to a different country. Then the eldestsaid Here we must part but this day four years we will come backto this spot and in the meantime each must try what he can do forhimself.So each brother went his way and as the eldest was hastening on a manmet him and asked him where he was going and what he wanted. I amgoing to try my luck in the world and should like to begin by learningsome art or trade answered he. Then said the man go with me andI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was. Nosaid the other that is not an honest calling and what can one lookto earn by it in the end but the gallows Oh said the man you neednot fear the gallows for I will only teach you to steal what will befair game I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or careanything about and where no one can find you out. So the young managreed to follow his trade and he soon showed himself so clever thatnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.The second brother also met a man who when he found out what he wassetting out upon asked him what craft he meant to follow. I do notknow yet said he. Then come with me and be a stargazer. It is anoble art for nothing can be hidden from you when once you understandthe stars. The plan pleased him much and he soon became such a skilfulstargazer that when he had served out his time and wanted to leavehis master he gave him a glass and said With this you can see allthat is passing in the sky and on earth and nothing can be hidden fromyou.The third brother met a huntsman who took him with him and taught himso well all that belonged to hunting that he became very clever in thecraft of the woods and when he left his master he gave him a bow andsaid Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished todo. Would not you like said he to be a tailor Oh no saidthe young man sitting crosslegged from morning to night workingbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose will never suit me.Oh answered the man that is not my sort of tailoring come with meand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that. Not knowingwhat better to do he came into the plan and learnt tailoring from thebeginning and when he left his master he gave him a needle and saidYou can sew anything with this be it as soft as an egg or as hard assteel and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.After the space of four years at the time agreed upon the fourbrothers met at the four crossroads and having welcomed each otherset off towards their fathers home where they told him all that hadhappened to them and how each had learned some craft.Then one day as they were sitting before the house under a very hightree the father said I should like to try what each of you can do inthis way. So he looked up and said to the second son At the top ofthis tree there is a chaffinchs nest tell me how many eggs there arein it. The stargazer took his glass looked up and said Five.Now said the father to the eldest son take away the eggs withoutletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them knowanything of what you are doing. So the cunning thief climbed up thetree and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the birdand it never saw or felt what he was doing but kept sitting on at itsease. Then the father took the eggs and put one on each corner of thetable and the fifth in the middle and said to the huntsman Cut allthe eggs in two pieces at one shot. The huntsman took up his bow andat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.Now comes your turn said he to the young tailor sew the eggs andthe young birds in them together again so neatly that the shot shallhave done them no harm. Then the tailor took his needle and sewed theeggs as he was told and when he had done the thief was sent to takethem back to the nest and put them under the bird without its knowingit. Then she went on sitting and hatched them and in a few days theycrawled out and had only a little red streak across their necks wherethe tailor had sewn them together.Well done sons said the old man you have made good use of yourtime and learnt something worth the knowing but I am sure I do notknow which ought to have the prize. Oh that a time might soon come foryou to turn your skill to some accountNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country for thekings daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon and the kingmourned over his loss day and night and made it known that whoeverbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the fourbrothers said to each other Here is a chance for us let us trywhat we can do. And they agreed to see whether they could not set theprincess free. I will soon find out where she is however said thestargazer as he looked through his glass and he soon cried out Isee her afar off sitting upon a rock in the sea and I can spy thedragon close by guarding her. Then he went to the king and asked fora ship for himself and his brothers and they sailed together over thesea till they came to the right place. There they found the princesssitting as the stargazer had said on the rock and the dragon waslying asleep with his head upon her lap. I dare not shoot at himsaid the huntsman for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.Then I will try my skill said the thief and went and stole her awayfrom under the dragon so quietly and gently that the beast did not knowit but went on snoring.Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards theship but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air forhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat andwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess the huntsman tookup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell downdead. They were still not safe for he was such a great beast that inhis fall he overset the boat and they had to swim in the open seaupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle and with a few largestitches put some of the planks together and he sat down upon theseand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat and then tackedthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready and they thenreached the ship and got home safe.When they had brought home the princess to her father there was greatrejoicing and he said to the four brothers One of you shall marryher but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be. Thenthere arose a quarrel between them and the stargazer said If I hadnot found the princess out all your skill would have been of no usetherefore she ought to be mine. Your seeing her would have been ofno use said the thief if I had not taken her away from the dragontherefore she ought to be mine. No she is mine said the huntsmanfor if I had not killed the dragon he would after all have torn youand the princess into pieces. And if I had not sewn the boat togetheragain said the tailor you would all have been drowned therefore sheis mine. Then the king put in a word and said Each of you is rightand as all cannot have the young lady the best way is for neither ofyou to have her for the truth is there is somebody she likes a greatdeal better. But to make up for your loss I will give each of you as areward for his skill half a kingdom. So the brothers agreed that thisplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady whohad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdomas he had said and they lived very happily the rest of their days andtook good care of their father and somebody took better care of theyoung lady than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen haveher again.LILY AND THE LIONA merchant who had three daughters was once setting out upon ajourney but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he shouldbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls the second for jewelsbut the third who was called Lily said Dear father bring me arose. Now it was no easy task to find a rose for it was the middleof winter yet as she was his prettiest daughter and was very fond offlowers her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed allthree and bid them goodbye.And when the time came for him to go home he had bought pearls andjewels for the two eldest but he had sought everywhere in vain for therose and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing thepeople laughed at him and asked him whether he thought roses grew insnow. This grieved him very much for Lily was his dearest child and ashe was journeying home thinking what he should bring her he came to afine castle and around the castle was a garden in one half of which itseemed to be summertime and in the other half winter. On one side thefinest flowers were in full bloom and on the other everything lookeddreary and buried in the snow. A lucky hit said he as he called tohis servant and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that wasthere and bring him away one of the finest flowers.This done they were riding away well pleased when up sprang a fiercelion and roared out Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten upalive Then the man said I knew not that the garden belonged to youcan nothing save my life No said the lion nothing unless youundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home if youagree to this I will give you your life and the rose too for yourdaughter. But the man was unwilling to do so and said It may be myyoungest daughter who loves me most and always runs to meet me whenI go home. Then the servant was greatly frightened and said It mayperhaps be only a cat or a dog. And at last the man yielded with aheavy heart and took the rose and said he would give the lion whatevershould meet him first on his return.And as he came near home it was Lily his youngest and dearestdaughter that met him she came running and kissed him and welcomedhim home and when she saw that he had brought her the rose she wasstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful and to weepsaying Alas my dearest child I have bought this flower at a highprice for I have said I would give you to a wild lion and when he hasyou he will tear you in pieces and eat you. Then he told her all thathad happened and said she should not go let what would happen.But she comforted him and said Dear father the word you have givenmust be kept I will go to the lion and soothe him perhaps he will letme come safe home again.The next morning she asked the way she was to go and took leave of herfather and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion wasan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions but in theevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to thecastle he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. Theweddingfeast was held and they lived happily together a long time. Theprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came and then he held hiscourt but every morning he left his bride and went away by himselfshe knew not whither till the night came again.After some time he said to her Tomorrow there will be a great feast inyour fathers house for your eldest sister is to be married and ifyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither. Then sherejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more and setout with the lions and everyone was overjoyed to see her for they hadthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was andstayed till the feast was over and then went back to the wood.Her second sister was soon after married and when Lily was asked togo to the wedding she said to the prince I will not go alone thistimeyou must go with me. But he would not and said that it would bea very hazardous thing for if the least ray of the torchlight shouldfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse for he should bechanged into a dove and be forced to wander about the world for sevenlong years. However she gave him no rest and said she would take careno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together andtook with them their little child and she chose a large hall with thickwalls for him to sit in while the weddingtorches were lighted butunluckily no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then thewedding was held with great pomp but as the train came from the churchand passed with the torches before the hall a very small ray of lightfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared and when his wife camein and looked for him she found only a white dove and it said to herSeven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth butevery now and then I will let fall a white feather that will show youthe way I am going follow it and at last you may overtake and set mefree.This said he flew out at the door and poor Lily followed and everynow and then a white feather fell and showed her the way she was tojourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world and lookedneither to the right hand nor to the left nor took any rest for sevenyears. Then she began to be glad and thought to herself that the timewas fast coming when all her troubles should end yet repose was stillfar off for one day as she was travelling on she missed the whitefeather and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.Now thought she to herself no aid of man can be of use to me. Soshe went to the sun and said Thou shinest everywhere on the hillstop and the valleys depthhast thou anywhere seen my white doveNo said the sun I have not seen it but I will give thee acasketopen it when thy hour of need comes.So she thanked the sun and went on her way till eventide and whenthe moon arose she cried unto it and said Thou shinest through thenight over field and grovehast thou nowhere seen my white doveNo said the moon I cannot help thee but I will give thee aneggbreak it when need comes.Then she thanked the moon and went on till the nightwind blew and sheraised up her voice to it and said Thou blowest through every treeand under every leafhast thou not seen my white dove No said thenightwind but I will ask three other winds perhaps they have seenit. Then the east wind and the west wind came and said they too hadnot seen it but the south wind said I have seen the white dovehehas fled to the Red Sea and is changed once more into a lion for theseven years are passed away and there he is fighting with a dragonand the dragon is an enchanted princess who seeks to separate him fromyou. Then the nightwind said I will give thee counsel. Go to theRed Sea on the right shore stand many rodscount them and when thoucomest to the eleventh break it off and smite the dragon with it andso the lion will have the victory and both of them will appear to youin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin wingedlike bird sitting by the Red Sea jump on to his back with thy belovedone as quickly as possible and he will carry you over the waters toyour home. I will also give thee this nut continued the nightwind.When you are halfway over throw it down and out of the waters willimmediately spring up a high nuttree on which the griffin will be ableto rest otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the wholeway if therefore thou dost forget to throw down the nut he will letyou both fall into the sea.So our poor wanderer went forth and found all as the nightwind hadsaid and she plucked the eleventh rod and smote the dragon and thelion forthwith became a prince and the dragon a princess again. Butno sooner was the princess released from the spell than she seizedthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffins back and went offcarrying the prince away with her.Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn but shetook heart and said As far as the wind blows and so long as the cockcrows I will journey on till I find him once again. She went on fora long long way till at length she came to the castle whither theprincess had carried the prince and there was a feast got ready andshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. Heaven aid me nowsaid she and she took the casket that the sun had given her and foundthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put iton and went into the palace and all the people gazed upon her andthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to besold. Not for gold and silver. said she but for flesh and blood.The princess asked what she meant and she said Let me speak with thebridegroom this night in his chamber and I will give thee the dress.At last the princess agreed but she told her chamberlain to give theprince a sleeping draught that he might not hear or see her. Whenevening came and the prince had fallen asleep she was led intohis chamber and she sat herself down at his feet and said I havefollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun the moon and thenightwind to seek thee and at last I have helped thee to overcomethe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite But the prince all the timeslept so soundly that her voice only passed over him and seemed likethe whistling of the wind among the firtrees.Then poor Lily was led away and forced to give up the golden dress andwhen she saw that there was no help for her she went out into a meadowand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself ofthe egg that the moon had given her and when she broke it there ranout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold that played about and thennestled under the old ones wings so as to form the most beautifulsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her till thebride saw them from her window and was so pleased that she came forthand asked her if she would sell the brood. Not for gold or silver butfor flesh and blood let me again this evening speak with the bridegroomin his chamber and I will give thee the whole brood.Then the princess thought to betray her as before and agreed towhat she asked but when the prince went to his chamber he askedthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And thechamberlain told him allhow he had given him a sleeping draught andhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber and wasto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away thesleeping draught and when Lily came and began again to tell him whatwoes had befallen her and how faithful and true to him she had beenhe knew his beloved wifes voice and sprang up and said You haveawakened me as from a dream for the strange princess had thrown a spellaround me so that I had altogether forgotten you but Heaven hath sentyou to me in a lucky hour.And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares and seatedthemselves on the griffin who flew back with them over the Red Sea.When they were halfway across Lily let the nut fall into the waterand immediately a large nuttree arose from the sea whereon the griffinrested for a while and then carried them safely home. There they foundtheir child now grown up to be comely and fair and after all theirtroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.THE FOX AND THE HORSEA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant tohim but he was now grown too old to work so the farmer would give himnothing more to eat and said I want you no longer so take yourselfoff out of my stable I shall not take you back again until you arestronger than a lion. Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.The poor horse was very melancholy and wandered up and down in thewood seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presentlya fox met him Whats the matter my friend said he why do you hangdown your head and look so lonely and woebegone Ah replied thehorse justice and avarice never dwell in one house my master hasforgotten all that I have done for him so many years and because Ican no longer work he has turned me adrift and says unless I becomestronger than a lion he will not take me back again what chance can Ihave of that he knows I have none or he would not talk so.However the fox bid him be of good cheer and said I will help youlie down there stretch yourself out quite stiff and pretend to bedead. The horse did as he was told and the fox went straight to thelion who lived in a cave close by and said to him A little way offlies a dead horse come with me and you may make an excellent meal ofhis carcase. The lion was greatly pleased and set off immediately andwhen they came to the horse the fox said You will not be able to eathim comfortably here Ill tell you whatI will tie you fast tohis tail and then you can draw him to your den and eat him at yourleisure.This advice pleased the lion so he laid himself down quietly for thefox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legstogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength hecould not set himself free. When the work was done the fox clapped thehorse on the shoulder and said Jip Dobbin Jip Then up he sprangand moved off dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roarand bellow till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright but thehorse let him sing on and made his way quietly over the fields to hismasters house.Here he is master said he I have got the better of him and whenthe farmer saw his old servant his heart relented and he said. Thoushalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of. And so the poor oldhorse had plenty to eat and livedtill he died.THE BLUE LIGHTThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served theking faithfully but when the war came to an end could serve no longerbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to himYou may return to your home I need you no longer and you will notreceive any more money for he only receives wages who renders meservice for them. Then the soldier did not know how to earn a livingwent away greatly troubled and walked the whole day until in theevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on he saw a lightwhich he went up to and came to a house wherein lived a witch. Do giveme one nights lodging and a little to eat and drink said he toher or I shall starve. Oho she answered who gives anything to arunaway soldier Yet will I be compassionate and take you in if youwill do what I wish. What do you wish said the soldier. That youshould dig all round my garden for me tomorrow. The soldier consentedand next day laboured with all his strength but could not finish it bythe evening. I see well enough said the witch that you can do nomore today but I will keep you yet another night in payment forwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood and chop it small. Thesoldier spent the whole day in doing it and in the evening the witchproposed that he should stay one night more. Tomorrow you shall onlydo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house there is an olddry well into which my light has fallen it burns blue and never goesout and you shall bring it up again. Next day the old woman took himto the well and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light andmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up but when hecame near the edge she stretched down her hand and wanted to take theblue light away from him. No said he perceiving her evil intentionI will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet uponthe ground. The witch fell into a passion let him fall again into thewell and went away.The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground and the bluelight went on burning but of what use was that to him He saw very wellthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfullythen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe whichwas still half full. This shall be my last pleasure thought hepulled it out lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When thesmoke had circled about the cavern suddenly a little black dwarf stoodbefore him and said Lord what are your commands What my commandsare replied the soldier quite astonished. I must do everything youbid me said the little man. Good said the soldier then in thefirst place help me out of this well. The little man took him by thehand and led him through an underground passage but he did not forgetto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him thetreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there and thesoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above he saidto the little man Now go and bind the old witch and carry her beforethe judge. In a short time she came by like the wind riding on a wildtomcat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little manreappeared. It is all done said he and the witch is already hangingon the gallows. What further commands has my lord inquired the dwarf.At this moment none answered the soldier you can return home onlybe at hand immediately if I summon you. Nothing more is needed thanthat you should light your pipe at the blue light and I will appearbefore you at once. Thereupon he vanished from his sight.The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to thebest inn ordered himself handsome clothes and then bade the landlordfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and thesoldier had taken possession of it he summoned the little black manikinand said I have served the king faithfully but he has dismissed meand left me to hunger and now I want to take my revenge. What am I todo asked the little man. Late at night when the kings daughter isin bed bring her here in her sleep she shall do servants work forme. The manikin said That is an easy thing for me to do but a verydangerous thing for you for if it is discovered you will fare ill.When twelve oclock had struck the door sprang open and the manikincarried in the princess. Aha are you there cried the soldier getto your work at once Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber. Whenshe had done this he ordered her to come to his chair and then hestretched out his feet and said Pull off my boots and then hethrew them in her face and made her pick them up again and cleanand brighten them. She however did everything he bade her withoutopposition silently and with halfshut eyes. When the first cockcrowed the manikin carried her back to the royal palace and laid herin her bed.Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father and toldhim that she had had a very strange dream. I was carried through thestreets with the rapidity of lightning said she and taken into asoldiers room and I had to wait upon him like a servant sweep hisroom clean his boots and do all kinds of menial work. It was only adream and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.The dream may have been true said the king. I will give you a pieceof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas and make a small hole in thepocket and then if you are carried away again they will fall out andleave a track in the streets. But unseen by the king the manikin wasstanding beside him when he said that and heard all. At night whenthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets some peascertainly did fall out of her pocket but they made no track for thecrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street therewas. And again the princess was compelled to do servants work untilcockcrow.Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track but it wasall in vain for in every street poor children were sitting picking uppeas and saying It must have rained peas last night. We must thinkof something else said the king keep your shoes on when you go tobed and before you come back from the place where you are taken hideone of them there I will soon contrive to find it. The black manikinheard this plot and at night when the soldier again ordered him tobring the princess revealed it to him and told him that he knew of noexpedient to counteract this stratagem and that if the shoe were foundin the soldiers house it would go badly with him. Do what I bid youreplied the soldier and again this third night the princess was obligedto work like a servant but before she went away she hid her shoe underthe bed.Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughtersshoe. It was found at the soldiers and the soldier himself who at theentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate was soon brought backand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuablethings he had the blue light and the gold and had only one ducat inhis pocket. And now loaded with chains he was standing at the window ofhis dungeon when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. Thesoldier tapped at the pane of glass and when this man came up said tohim Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying inthe inn and I will give you a ducat for doing it. His comrade ranthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was aloneagain he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. Have nofear said the latter to his master. Go wheresoever they take you andlet them do what they will only take the blue light with you. Next daythe soldier was tried and though he had done nothing wicked the judgecondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die he begged a lastfavour of the king. What is it asked the king. That I may smoke onemore pipe on my way. You may smoke three answered the king but donot imagine that I will spare your life. Then the soldier pulled outhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light and as soon as a few wreathsof smoke had ascended the manikin was there with a small cudgel in hishand and said What does my lord command Strike down to earth thatfalse judge there and his constable and spare not the king who hastreated me so ill. Then the manikin fell on them like lightningdarting this way and that way and whosoever was so much as touched byhis cudgel fell to earth and did not venture to stir again. The kingwas terrified he threw himself on the soldiers mercy and merely tobe allowed to live at all gave him his kingdom for his own and hisdaughter to wife.THE RAVENThere was once a queen who had a little daughter still too young to runalone. One day the child was very troublesome and the mother could notquiet it do what she would. She grew impatient and seeing the ravensflying round the castle she opened the window and said I wish youwere a raven and would fly away then I should have a little peace.Scarcely were the words out of her mouth when the child in her arms wasturned into a raven and flew away from her through the open window. Thebird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long timeand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.Long after this a man was making his way through the wood when he hearda raven calling and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drewnear the raven said I am by birth a kings daughter but am now underthe spell of some enchantment you can however set me free. Whatam I to do he asked. She replied Go farther into the wood until youcome to a house wherein lives an old woman she will offer you food anddrink but you must not take of either if you do you will fall intoa deep sleep and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind thehouse is a large tanheap and on that you must stand and watch for me.I shall drive there in my carriage at two oclock in the afternoon forthree successive days the first day it will be drawn by four white thesecond by four chestnut and the last by four black horses but if youfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping I shall not be set free.The man promised to do all that she wished but the raven said Alas Iknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unableto save me. The man assured her again that he would on no account toucha thing to eat or drink.When he came to the house and went inside the old woman met him andsaid Poor man how tired you are Come in and rest and let me give yousomething to eat and drink.No answered the man I will neither eat not drink.But she would not leave him alone and urged him saying If you willnot eat anything at least you might take a draught of wine one drinkcounts for nothing and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded anddrank.As it drew towards the appointed hour he went outside into the gardenand mounted the tanheap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling offatigue came over him and unable to resist it he lay down for a littlewhile fully determined however to keep awake but in another minutehis eyes closed of their own accord and he fell into such a deep sleepthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At twooclock the raven came driving along drawn by her four white horsesbut even before she reached the spot she said to herself sighing Iknow he has fallen asleep. When she entered the garden there she foundhim as she had feared lying on the tanheap fast asleep. She got outof her carriage and went to him she called him and shook him but itwas all in vain he still continued sleeping.The next day at noon the old woman came to him again with food anddrink which he at first refused. At last overcome by her persistententreaties that he would take something he lifted the glass and drankagain.Towards two oclock he went into the garden and on to the tanheap towatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feelso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him and he couldnot stand upright any longer so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses she said sorrowfullyto herself I know he has fallen asleep. She went as before to lookfor him but he slept and it was impossible to awaken him.The following day the old woman said to him What is this You are noteating or drinking anything do you want to kill yourselfHe answered I may not and will not either eat or drink.But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of himand when he smelt the wine he was unable to resist the temptation andtook a deep draught.When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tanheap inthe garden to await the kings daughter but he felt even more overcomewith weariness than on the two previous days and throwing himself downhe slept like a log. At two oclock the raven could be seen approachingand this time her coachman and everything about her as well as herhorses were black.She was sadder than ever as she drove along and said mournfully Iknow he has fallen asleep and will not be able to set me free. Shefound him sleeping heavily and all her efforts to awaken him were of noavail. Then she placed beside him a loaf and some meat and a flaskof wine of such a kind that however much he took of them they wouldnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring on which her name wasengraved off her finger and put it upon one of his. Finally she laida letter near him in which after giving him particulars of the foodand drink she had left for him she finished with the following wordsI see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set mefree if however you still wish to do so come to the golden castleof Stromberg this is well within your power to accomplish. She thenreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping he was grievedat heart and said She has no doubt been here and driven away againand it is now too late for me to save her. Then his eyes fell on thethings which were lying beside him he read the letter and knew from itall that had happened. He rose up without delay eager to start on hisway and to reach the castle of Stromberg but he had no idea in whichdirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of itand came at last to a dark forest through which he went on walking forfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the nightcame on and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Againthe next day he pursued his way through the forest and that eveningthinking to rest again he lay down as before but he heard such ahowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited tillit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses and thenseeing a little glimmer ahead of him he went towards it.He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller thanit really was from the contrast of its height with that of an immensegiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself If the giantsees me going in my life will not be worth much. However after awhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw himhe called out It is lucky for that you have come for I have not hadanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper. Iwould rather you let that alone said the man for I do not willinglygive myself up to be eaten if you are wanting food I have enough tosatisfy your hunger. If that is so replied the giant I will leaveyou in peace I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.So they went indoors together and sat down and the man brought out thebread meat and wine which although he had eaten and drunk of themwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer andate and drank to his hearts content. When he had finished his supperthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.The giant said I will look on my map on it are marked all the townsvillages and houses. So he fetched his map and looked for the castlebut could not find it. Never mind he said I have larger mapsupstairs in the cupboard we will look on those but they searched invain for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thoughthe should like to continue his journey but the giant begged him toremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother who wasaway in search of provisions. When the brother came home they asked himabout the castle of Stromberg and he told them he would look on his ownmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly whenhe had finished his supper they all went up together to his room andlooked through his maps but the castle was not to be found. Then hefetched other older maps and they went on looking for the castle untilat last they found it but it was many thousand miles away. How shall Ibe able to get there asked the man. I have two hours to spare saidthe giant and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle Imust then return to look after the child who is in our care.The giant thereupon carried the man to within about a hundred leaguesof the castle where he left him saying You will be able to walk theremainder of the way yourself. The man journeyed on day and nighttill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situatedhowever on a glass mountain and looking up from the foot he saw theenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He wasoverjoyed to see her and longed to get to the top of the mountain butthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb hefell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her he wasgreatly grieved and said to himself I will remain here and wait forher so he built himself a little hut and there he sat and watched fora whole year and every day he saw the kings daughter driving round hercastle but still was unable to get nearer to her.Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and hecalled out to them God be with you. They stopped when they heard thecall but looking round and seeing nobody they went on again with theirfighting which now became more furious. God be with you he criedagain and again they paused and looked about but seeing no one wentback to their fighting. A third time he called out God be with youand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute betweenthe three men he went out and asked them why they were fighting soangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stickand that he had but to strike it against any door through which hewished to pass and it immediately flew open. Another told him that hehad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible and the third hadcaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle and evenup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether theywould keep together and have the things in common or whether they wouldseparate. On hearing this the man said I will give you something inexchange for those three things not money for that I have not gotbut something that is of far more value. I must first however provewhether all you have told me about your three things is true. Therobbers therefore made him get on the horse and handed him the stickand the cloak and when he had put this round him he was no longervisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one afteranother crying There you idle vagabonds you have got what youdeserve are you satisfied nowAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate ofthe castle he found it closed but he gave it a blow with his stickand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted thesteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting with a goldengoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he stillwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his fingerand threw it into the goblet so that it rang as it touched the bottom.That is my own ring she exclaimed and if that is so the man mustalso be here who is coming to set me free.She sought for him about the castle but could find him nowhere.Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown offthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him andcried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms andshe kissed him and said Now you have indeed set me free and tomorrowwe will celebrate our marriage.THE GOLDEN GOOSEThere was a man who had three sons the youngest of whom was calledDummling and was despised mocked and sneered at on every occasion.It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew woodand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and abottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.When he entered the forest he met a little greyhaired old man who badehim good day and said Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocketand let me have a draught of your wine I am so hungry and thirsty. Butthe clever son answered If I give you my cake and wine I shall havenone for myself be off with you and he left the little man standingand went on.But when he began to hew down a tree it was not long before he made afalse stroke and the axe cut him in the arm so that he had to go homeand have it bound up. And this was the little grey mans doing.After this the second son went into the forest and his mother gave himlike the eldest a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey manmet him likewise and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.But the second son too said sensibly enough What I give you will betaken away from myself be off and he left the little man standing andwent on. His punishment however was not delayed when he had made afew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg so that he had to becarried home.Then Dummling said Father do let me go and cut wood. The fatheranswered Your brothers have hurt themselves with it leave it aloneyou do not understand anything about it. But Dummling begged so longthat at last he said Just go then you will get wiser by hurtingyourself. His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in thecinders and with it a bottle of sour beer.When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewiseand greeting him said Give me a piece of your cake and a drink outof your bottle I am so hungry and thirsty. Dummling answered I haveonly cindercake and sour beer if that pleases you we will sitdown and eat. So they sat down and when Dummling pulled out hiscindercake it was a fine sweet cake and the sour beer had become goodwine. So they ate and drank and after that the little man said Sinceyou have a good heart and are willing to divide what you have I willgive you good luck. There stands an old tree cut it down and you willfind something at the roots. Then the little man took leave of him.Dummling went and cut down the tree and when it fell there was a goosesitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up andtaking her with him went to an inn where he thought he would stay thenight. Now the host had three daughters who saw the goose and werecurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be and would haveliked to have one of its golden feathers.The eldest thought I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out afeather and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose bythe wing but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.The second came soon afterwards thinking only of how she might get afeather for herself but she had scarcely touched her sister than shewas held fast.At last the third also came with the like intent and the othersscreamed out Keep away for goodness sake keep away But she didnot understand why she was to keep away. The others are there shethought I may as well be there too and ran to them but as soon asshe had touched her sister she remained sticking fast to her. So theyhad to spend the night with the goose.The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set outwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on toit. They were obliged to run after him continually now left now rightwherever his legs took him.In the middle of the fields the parson met them and when he saw theprocession he said For shame you goodfornothing girls why are yourunning across the fields after this young man Is that seemly At thesame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her awaybut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast and was himselfobliged to run behind.Before long the sexton came by and saw his master the parson runningbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out Hiyour reverence whither away so quickly Do not forget that we have achristening today and running after him he took him by the sleeve butwas also held fast to it.Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other two labourerscame with their hoes from the fields the parson called out to themand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they hadscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast and now there wereseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.Soon afterwards he came to a city where a king ruled who had a daughterwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put fortha decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marryher. When Dummling heard this he went with his goose and all her trainbefore the kings daughter and as soon as she saw the seven peoplerunning on and on one behind the other she began to laugh quiteloudly and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to haveher for his wife but the king did not like the soninlaw and made allmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drinka cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man who couldcertainly help him so he went into the forest and in the same placewhere he had felled the tree he saw a man sitting who had a verysorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart sosorely and he answered I have such a great thirst and cannot quenchit cold water I cannot stand a barrel of wine I have just emptied butthat to me is like a drop on a hot stoneThere I can help you said Dummling just come with me and you shallbe satisfied.He led him into the kings cellar and the man bent over the hugebarrels and drank and drank till his loins hurt and before the day wasout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once morefor his bride but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow whomeveryone called Dummling should take away his daughter and he made anew condition he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountainof bread. Dummling did not think long but went straight into theforest where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up hisbody with a strap and making an awful face and saying I have eaten awhole ovenful of rolls but what good is that when one has such a hungeras I My stomach remains empty and I must tie myself up if I am not todie of hunger.At this Dummling was glad and said Get up and come with me you shalleat yourself full. He led him to the kings palace where all theflour in the whole Kingdom was collected and from it he caused a hugemountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before itbegan to eat and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride but the king againsought a way out and ordered a ship which could sail on land and onwater. As soon as you come sailing back in it said he you shallhave my daughter for wife.Dummling went straight into the forest and there sat the little greyman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wantedhe said Since you have given me to eat and to drink I will give youthe ship and I do all this because you once were kind to me. Then hegave him the ship which could sail on land and water and when the kingsaw that he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. Thewedding was celebrated and after the kings death Dummling inheritedhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.      SimpletonTHE WATER OF LIFELong before you or I were born there reigned in a country a great wayoff a king who had three sons. This king once fell very illso illthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grievedat their fathers sickness and as they were walking together verymournfully in the garden of the palace a little old man met them andasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very illand that they were afraid nothing could save him. I know what wouldsaid the little old man it is the Water of Life. If he could have adraught of it he would be well again but it is very hard to get. Thenthe eldest son said I will soon find it and he went to the sickking and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life asit was the only thing that could save him. No said the king. I hadrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with inyour journey. But he begged so hard that the king let him go and theprince thought to himself If I bring my father this water he willmake me sole heir to his kingdom.Then he set out and when he had gone on his way some time he came to adeep valley overhung with rocks and woods and as he looked around hesaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf with asugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak and the dwarf called to him and saidPrince whither so fast What is that to thee you ugly imp saidthe prince haughtily and rode on.But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour and laid a fairy spellof illluck upon him so that as he rode on the mountain pass becamenarrower and narrower and at last the way was so straitened that hecould not go to step forward and when he thought to have turned hishorse round and go back the way he came he heard a loud laugh ringinground him and found that the path was closed behind him so that he wasshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his wayon foot but again the laugh rang in his ears and he found himselfunable to move a step and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his sonsreturn till at last the second son said Father I will go in searchof the Water of Life. For he thought to himself My brother is surelydead and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water. The king wasat first very unwilling to let him go but at last yielded to his wish.So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had doneand met with the same elf who stopped him at the same spot in themountains saying as before Prince prince whither so fast Mindyour own affairs busybody said the prince scornfully and rode on.But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elderbrother and he too was at last obliged to take up his abode in theheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people who thinkthemselves above everyone else and are too proud to ask or take advice.When the second prince had thus been gone a long time the youngest sonsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life and trusted he shouldsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out and the dwarfmet him too at the same spot in the valley among the mountains andsaid Prince whither so fast And the prince said I am going insearch of the Water of Life because my father is ill and like to diecan you help me Pray be kind and aid me if you can Do you knowwhere it is to be found asked the dwarf. No said the prince I donot. Pray tell me if you know. Then as you have spoken to me kindlyand are wise enough to seek for advice I will tell you how and where togo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle andthat you may be able to reach it in safety I will give you an iron wandand two little loaves of bread strike the iron door of the castle threetimes with the wand and it will open two hungry lions will be lyingdown inside gaping for their prey but if you throw them the bread theywill let you pass then hasten on to the well and take some of theWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve for if you tarry longerthe door will shut upon you for ever.Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for hisfriendly aid and took the wand and the bread and went travelling onand on over sea and over land till he came to his journeys end andfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open atthe third stroke of the wand and when the lions were quieted he went onthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it hesaw several knights sitting in a trance then he pulled off their ringsand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table asword and a loaf of bread which he also took. Further on he came to aroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch and she welcomed himjoyfully and said if he would set her free from the spell that boundher the kingdom should be his if he would come back in a year andmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Lifewas in the palace gardens and bade him make haste and draw what hewanted before the clock struck twelve.He walked on and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to adelightful shady spot in which stood a couch and he thought to himselfas he felt tired that he would rest himself for a while and gaze onthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down and sleepfell upon him unawares so that he did not wake up till the clock wasstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfullyfrightened ran to the well filled a cup that was standing by him fullof water and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out ofthe iron door it struck twelve and the door fell so quickly upon himthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.When he found himself safe he was overjoyed to think that he had gotthe Water of Life and as he was going on his way homewards he passedby the little dwarf who when he saw the sword and the loaf said Youhave made a noble prize with the sword you can at a blow slay wholearmies and the bread will never fail you. Then the prince thoughtto himself I cannot go home to my father without my brothers so hesaid My dear friend cannot you tell me where my two brothers are whoset out in search of the Water of Life before me and never came backI have shut them up by a charm between two mountains said the dwarfbecause they were proud and illbehaved and scorned to ask advice.The prince begged so hard for his brothers that the dwarf at last setthem free though unwillingly saying Beware of them for they havebad hearts. Their brother however was greatly rejoiced to see themand told them all that had happened to him how he had found the Waterof Life and had taken a cup full of it and how he had set a beautifulprincess free from a spell that bound her and how she had engaged towait a whole year and then to marry him and to give him the kingdom.Then they all three rode on together and on their way home came to acountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine so that it wasfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the landthe bread and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king thewonderful sword and he slew the enemys army with it and thus thekingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner hebefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.When they came to the sea they got into a ship and during their voyagethe two eldest said to themselves Our brother has got the water whichwe could not find therefore our father will forsake us and give him thekingdom which is our right so they were full of envy and revenge andagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he wasfast asleep and poured the Water of Life out of the cup and took itfor themselves giving him bitter seawater instead.When they came to their journeys end the youngest son brought his cupto the sick king that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely howeverhad he tasted the bitter seawater when he became worse even than he wasbefore and then both the elder sons came in and blamed the youngestfor what they had done and said that he wanted to poison their fatherbut that they had found the Water of Life and had brought it with them.He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him than he felt hissickness leave him and was as strong and well as in his younger days.Then they went to their brother and laughed at him and said Wellbrother you found the Water of Life did you You have had the troubleand we shall have the reward. Pray with all your cleverness why didnot you manage to keep your eyes open Next year one of us will takeaway your beautiful princess if you do not take care. You had bettersay nothing about this to our father for he does not believe a word yousay and if you tell tales you shall lose your life into the bargainbut be quiet and we will let you off.The old king was still very angry with his youngest son and thoughtthat he really meant to have taken away his life so he called his courttogether and asked what should be done and all agreed that he ought tobe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on till oneday when the kings chief huntsmen went ahunting with him and theywere alone in the wood together the huntsman looked so sorrowful thatthe prince said My friend what is the matter with you I cannot anddare not tell you said he. But the prince begged very hard and saidOnly tell me what it is and do not think I shall be angry for I willforgive you. Alas said the huntsman the king has ordered me toshoot you. The prince started at this and said Let me live and Iwill change dresses with you you shall take my royal coat to show to myfather and do you give me your shabby one. With all my heart saidthe huntsman I am sure I shall be glad to save you for I could nothave shot you. Then he took the princes coat and gave him the shabbyone and went away through the wood.Some time after three grand embassies came to the old kings courtwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son nowall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his swordand loaf of bread in order to rid them of their enemy and feed theirpeople. This touched the old kings heart and he thought his son mightstill be guiltless and said to his court O that my son were stillalive how it grieves me that I had him killed He is still alivesaid the huntsman and I am glad that I had pity on him but let himgo in peace and brought home his royal coat. At this the king wasoverwhelmed with joy and made it known throughout all his kingdom thatif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer shouldcome back and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shininggold and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback and rodestraight up to the gate upon it was her true lover and that they mustlet him in but whoever rode on one side of it they must be sure wasnot the right one and that they must send him away at once.The time soon came when the eldest brother thought that he would makehaste to go to the princess and say that he was the one who had sether free and that he should have her for his wife and the kingdom withher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road he stopped tolook at it and he thought to himself It is a pity to ride upon thisbeautiful road so he turned aside and rode on the righthand side ofit. But when he came to the gate the guards who had seen the roadhe took said to him he could not be what he said he was and must goabout his business.The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand and whenhe came to the golden road and his horse had set one foot upon ithe stopped to look at it and thought it very beautiful and said tohimself What a pity it is that anything should tread here Then hetoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came tothe gate the guards said he was not the true prince and that he toomust go away about his business and away he went.Now when the full year was come round the third brother left the forestin which he had lain hid for fear of his fathers anger and set out insearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on thinking of her allthe way and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road wasmade of but went with his horse straight over it and as he came to thegate it flew open and the princess welcomed him with joy and saidhe was her deliverer and should now be her husband and lord of thekingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over the princess toldhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him and of his wish tohave him home again so before his wedding with the princess he wentto visit his father taking her with him. Then he told him everythinghow his brothers had cheated and robbed him and yet that he had borneall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was veryangry and wanted to punish his wicked sons but they made their escapeand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea and where theywent to nobody knew and nobody cared.And now the old king gathered together his court and asked all hiskingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.And young and old noble and squire gentle and simple came at onceon the summons and among the rest came the friendly dwarf with thesugarloaf hat and a new scarlet cloak.  And the wedding was held and the merry bells run.  And all the good people they danced and they sung  And feasted and frolickd I cant tell how long.THE TWELVE HUNTSMENThere was once a kings son who had a bride whom he loved very much. Andwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy news came that his fatherlay sick unto death and desired to see him once again before his end.Then he said to his beloved I must now go and leave you I give youa ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king I will return and fetchyou. So he rode away and when he reached his father the latter wasdangerously ill and near his death. He said to him Dear son I wishedto see you once again before my end promise me to marry as I wish andhe named a certain kings daughter who was to be his wife. The son wasin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing and said Yesdear father your will shall be done and thereupon the king shut hiseyes and died.When therefore the son had been proclaimed king and the time ofmourning was over he was forced to keep the promise which he had givenhis father and caused the kings daughter to be asked in marriage andshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this and frettedso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her fathersaid to her Dearest child why are you so sad You shall havewhatsoever you will. She thought for a moment and said Dear fatherI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face figure and size.The father said If it be possible your desire shall be fulfilledand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom until elevenyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in facefigure and size.When they came to the kings daughter she had twelve suits ofhuntsmens clothes made all alike and the eleven maidens had to puton the huntsmens clothes and she herself put on the twelfth suit.Thereupon she took her leave of her father and rode away with themand rode to the court of her former betrothed whom she loved so dearly.Then she asked if he required any huntsmen and if he would take all ofthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her butas they were such handsome fellows he said Yes and that he wouldwillingly take them and now they were the kings twelve huntsmen.The king however had a lion which was a wondrous animal for he knewall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening hesaid to the king You think you have twelve huntsmen Yes said theking they are twelve huntsmen. The lion continued You are mistakenthey are twelve girls. The king said That cannot be true Howwill you prove that to me Oh just let some peas be strewn in theantechamber answered the lion and then you will soon see. Men havea firm step and when they walk over peas none of them stir but girlstrip and skip and drag their feet and the peas roll about. The kingwas well pleased with the counsel and caused the peas to be strewn.There was however a servant of the kings who favoured the huntsmenand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went tothem and repeated everything and said The lion wants to make the kingbelieve that you are girls. Then the kings daughter thanked him andsaid to her maidens Show some strength and step firmly on the peas.So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called beforehim and they came into the antechamber where the peas were lying theystepped so firmly on them and had such a strong sure walk that notone of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away againand the king said to the lion You have lied to me they walk just likemen. The lion said They have been informed that they were going tobe put to the test and have assumed some strength. Just let twelvespinningwheels be brought into the antechamber and they will go tothem and be pleased with them and that is what no man would do.The king liked the advice and had the spinningwheels placed in theantechamber.But the servant who was well disposed to the huntsmen went to themand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the kings daughtersaid to her eleven girls Show some constraint and do not look roundat the spinningwheels. And next morning when the king had his twelvehuntsmen summoned they went through the antechamber and never oncelooked at the spinningwheels. Then the king again said to the lionYou have deceived me they are men for they have not looked at thespinningwheels. The lion replied They have restrained themselves.The king however would no longer believe the lion.The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase and hisliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass thatonce when they were out hunting news came that the kings bride wasapproaching. When the true bride heard that it hurt her so much thather heart was almost broken and she fell fainting to the ground. Theking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman ran up to himwanted to help him and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring whichhe had given to his first bride and when he looked in her face herecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her andwhen she opened her eyes he said You are mine and I am yours andno one in the world can alter that. He sent a messenger to the otherbride and entreated her to return to her own kingdom for he had a wifealready and someone who had just found an old key did not require a newone. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated and the lion was again takeninto favour because after all he had told the truth.THE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAINThere was once a merchant who had only one child a son that was veryyoung and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships thenmaking a voyage upon the seas in which he had embarked all his wealthin the hope of making great gains when the news came that both werelost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor thatnothing was left to him but one small plot of land and there he oftenwent in an evening to take his walk and ease his mind of a little ofhis trouble.One day as he was roaming along in a brown study thinking with nogreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was and was liketo be all on a sudden there stood before him a little roughlookingblack dwarf. Prithee friend why so sorrowful said he to themerchant what is it you take so deeply to heart If you would do meany good I would willingly tell you said the merchant. Who knows butI may said the little man tell me what ails you and perhaps youwill find I may be of some use. Then the merchant told him how all hiswealth was gone to the bottom of the sea and how he had nothing leftbut that little plot of land. Oh trouble not yourself about thatsaid the dwarf only undertake to bring me here twelve years hencewhatever meets you first on your going home and I will give you as muchas you please. The merchant thought this was no great thing to askthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat or something of thatsort but forgot his little boy Heinel so he agreed to the bargain andsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.But as he drew near home his little boy was so glad to see him that hecrept behind him and laid fast hold of his legs and looked up inhis face and laughed. Then the father started trembling with fear andhorror and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do but as nogold was come he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a jokethat the dwarf was playing him and that at any rate when the moneycame he should see the bearer and would not take it in.About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumberroom to lookfor some old iron that he might sell it and raise a little money andthere instead of his iron he saw a large pile of gold lying on thefloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed and forgetting all abouthis son went into trade again and became a richer merchant thanbefore.Meantime little Heinel grew up and as the end of the twelve years drewnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond and became very sadand thoughtful so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. Theboy one day asked what was the matter but his father would not tell forsome time at last however he said that he had without knowing itsold him for gold to a little uglylooking black dwarf and that thetwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinelsaid Father give yourself very little trouble about that I shall betoo much for the little man.When the time came the father and son went out together to the placeagreed upon and the son drew a circle on the ground and set himselfand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon cameand walked round and round about the circle but could not find any wayto get into it and he either could not or dared not jump over it. Atlast the boy said to him. Have you anything to say to us my friend orwhat do you want Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy thatwas fond of him and had told him what to do for this fairy knew whatgood luck was in store for him. Have you brought me what you said youwould said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue butHeinel said again What do you want here The dwarf said I come totalk with your father not with you. You have cheated and taken in myfather said the son pray give him up his bond at once. Fair andsoftly said the little old man right is right I have paid my moneyand your father has had it and spent it so be so good as to let mehave what I paid it for. You must have my consent to that first saidHeinel so please to step in here and let us talk it over. The oldman grinned and showed his teeth as if he should have been very gladto get into the circle if he could. Then at last after a long talkthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up andthat so far the dwarf should have his way but on the other hand thefairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him if he followedhis own course and he did not choose to be given up to his humpbackedfriend who seemed so anxious for his company.So to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter it was settled thatHeinel should be put into an open boat that lay on the seashore hardby that the father should push him off with his own hand and that heshould thus be set adrift and left to the bad or good luck of wind andweather. Then he took leave of his father and set himself in the boatbut before it got far off a wave struck it and it fell with one sidelow in the water so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost andwent home very sorrowful while the dwarf went his way thinking that atany rate he had had his revenge.The boat however did not sink for the good fairy took care of herfriend and soon raised the boat up again and it went safely on. Theyoung man sat safe within till at length it ran ashore upon an unknownland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castlebut empty and dreary within for it was enchanted. Here said he tohimself must I find the prize the good fairy told me of. So he oncemore searched the whole palace through till at last he found a whitesnake lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.Now the white snake was an enchanted princess and she was very gladto see him and said Are you at last come to set me free Twelvelong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as shepromised for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will cometheir faces will be black and they will be dressed in chain armour.They will ask what you do here but give no answer and let them dowhat they willbeat whip pinch prick or torment youbear all onlyspeak not a word and at twelve oclock they must go away. The secondnight twelve others will come and the third night twentyfour whowill even cut off your head but at the twelfth hour of that night theirpower is gone and I shall be free and will come and bring you theWater of Life and will wash you with it and bring you back to lifeand health. And all came to pass as she had said Heinel bore all andspoke not a word and the third night the princess came and fell on hisneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castlethe wedding was celebrated and he was crowned king of the GoldenMountain.They lived together very happily and the queen had a son. And thuseight years had passed over their heads when the king thought of hisfather and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen wasagainst his going and said I know well that misfortunes will comeupon us if you go. However he gave her no rest till she agreed. At hisgoing away she gave him a wishingring and said Take this ring andput it on your finger whatever you wish it will bring you only promisenever to make use of it to bring me hence to your fathers house. Thenhe said he would do what she asked and put the ring on his finger andwished himself near the town where his father lived.Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment but the guards wouldnot let him go in because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to aneighbouring hill where a shepherd dwelt and borrowed his old frockand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his fathershouse he said he was his son but the merchant would not believe himand said he had had but one son his poor Heinel who he knew was longsince dead and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd he wouldnot even give him anything to eat. The king however still vowed thathe was his son and said Is there no mark by which you would know meif I am really your son Yes said his mother our Heinel had a marklike a raspberry on his right arm. Then he showed them the mark andthey knew that what he had said was true.He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain and wasmarried to a princess and had a son seven years old. But the merchantsaid that can never be true he must be a fine king truly who travelsabout in a shepherds frock At this the son was vexed and forgettinghis word turned his ring and wished for his queen and son. In aninstant they stood before him but the queen wept and said he hadbroken his word and bad luck would follow. He did all he could tosoothe her and she at last seemed to be appeased but she was not so intruth and was only thinking how she should punish him.One day he took her to walk with him out of the town and showed herthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sathimself down and said I am very much tired sit by me I will rest myhead in your lap and sleep a while. As soon as he had fallen asleephowever she drew the ring from his finger and crept softly away andwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awokehe found himself alone and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.I can never go back to my fathers house said he they would say Iam a sorcerer I will journey forth into the world till I come again tomy kingdom.So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill where threegiants were sharing their fathers goods and as they saw him pass theycried out and said Little men have sharp wits he shall part the goodsbetween us. Now there was a sword that cut off an enemys head wheneverthe wearer gave the words Heads off a cloak that made the ownerinvisible or gave him any form he pleased and a pair of boots thatcarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first lethim try these wonderful things then he might know how to set a valueupon them. Then they gave him the cloak and he wished himself a flyand in a moment he was a fly. The cloak is very well said he nowgive me the sword. No said they not unless you undertake not tosay Heads off for if you do we are all dead men. So they gave ithim charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots alsoand the moment he had all three in his power he wished himself atthe Golden Mountain and there he was at once. So the giants were leftbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music andthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry anotherhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him and passed through thecastle hall and placed himself by the side of the queen where no onesaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate he took itaway and ate it himself and when a glass of wine was handed to her hetook it and drank it and thus though they kept on giving her meat anddrink her plate and cup were always empty.Upon this fear and remorse came over her and she went into her chamberalone and sat there weeping and he followed her there. Alas saidshe to herself was I not once set free Why then does this enchantmentstill seem to bind meFalse and fickle one said he. One indeed came who set thee free andhe is now near thee again but how have you used him Ought he tohave had such treatment from thee Then he went out and sent away thecompany and said the wedding was at an end for that he was come backto the kingdom. But the princes peers and great men mocked at him.However he would enter into no parley with them but only asked themif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and triedto seize him but he drew his sword. Heads Off cried he and with theword the traitors heads fell before him and Heinel was once more kingof the Golden Mountain.DOCTOR KNOWALLThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb who drove withtwo oxen a load of wood to the town and sold it to a doctor for twotalers. When the money was being counted out to him it so happened thatthe doctor was sitting at table and when the peasant saw how well heate and drank his heart desired what he saw and would willinglyhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while and at lengthinquired if he too could not be a doctor. Oh yes said the doctorthat is soon managed. What must I do asked the peasant. In thefirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock onthe frontispiece in the second turn your cart and your two oxen intomoney and get yourself some clothes and whatsoever else pertains tomedicine thirdly have a sign painted for yourself with the words Iam Doctor Knowall and have that nailed up above your housedoor. Thepeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctoredpeople awhile but not long a rich and great lord had some moneystolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and sucha village and must know what had become of the money. So the lord hadthe horses harnessed to his carriage drove out to the village andasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes he was he said. Then he wasto go with him and bring back the stolen money. Oh yes but Grete mywife must go too. The lord was willing and let both of them have aseat in the carriage and they all drove away together. When they cameto the noblemans castle the table was spread and Crabb was told tosit down and eat. Yes but my wife Grete too said he and he seatedhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with adish of delicate fare the peasant nudged his wife and said Gretethat was the first meaning that was the servant who brought the firstdish. The servant however thought he intended by that to say That isthe first thief and as he actually was so he was terrified and saidto his comrade outside The doctor knows all we shall fare ill hesaid I was the first. The second did not want to go in at all but wasforced. So when he went in with his dish the peasant nudged his wifeand said Grete that is the second. This servant was equally alarmedand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better for thepeasant again said Grete that is the third. The fourth had to carryin a dish that was covered and the lord told the doctor that he was toshow his skill and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually therewere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish had no idea what to say andcried Ah poor Crabb. When the lord heard that he cried There heknows it he must also know who has the moneyOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy and made a sign to thedoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When thereforehe went out all four of them confessed to him that they had stolenthe money and said that they would willingly restore it and give him aheavy sum into the bargain if he would not denounce them for if hedid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money wasconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied and returned to the hallsat down to the table and said My lord now will I search in my bookwhere the gold is hidden. The fifth servant however crept into thestove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat stilland opened his A B C book turned the pages backwards and forwards andlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said Iknow you are there so you had better come out Then the fellow in thestove thought that the doctor meant him and full of terror sprang outcrying That man knows everything Then Doctor Knowall showed the lordwhere the money was but did not say who had stolen it and receivedfrom both sides much money in reward and became a renowned man.THE SEVEN RAVENSThere was once a man who had seven sons and last of all one daughter.Although the little girl was very pretty she was so weak and small thatthey thought she could not live but they said she should at once bechristened.So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get somewater but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first atdrawing the water and so they were in such a hurry that all let theirpitchers fall into the well and they stood very foolishly looking atone another and did not know what to do for none dared go home. In themeantime the father was uneasy and could not tell what made theyoung men stay so long. Surely said he the whole seven must haveforgotten themselves over some game of play and when he had waitedstill longer and they yet did not come he flew into a rage and wishedthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when heheard a croaking over his head and looked up and saw seven ravens asblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wishso fulfilled he did not know how what was done could be undone andcomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sonswith his dear little daughter who soon became stronger and every daymore beautiful.For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers forher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her but oneday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. Yes saidthey she is beautiful indeed but still tis a pity that her brothersshould have been lost for her sake. Then she was much grieved and wentto her father and mother and asked if she had any brothers and whathad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her butsaid it was the will of Heaven and that her birth was only the innocentcause of it but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day andthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers backand she had neither rest nor ease till at length one day she stoleaway and set out into the wide world to find her brothers whereverthey might be and free them whatever it might cost her.She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and motherhad given her a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry a littlepitcher of water in case she should be thirsty and a little stoolto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on andjourneyed till she came to the worlds end then she came to the sunbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery so she ran away quickly tothe moon but the moon was cold and chilly and said I smell fleshand blood this way so she took herself away in a hurry and came to thestars and the stars were friendly and kind to her and each star satupon his own little stool but the morning star rose up and gave her alittle piece of wood and said If you have not this little piece ofwood you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glassmountainand there your brothers live. The little girl took the piece of woodrolled it up in a little cloth and went on again until she came to theglassmountain and found the door shut. Then she felt for the littlepiece of wood but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there andshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be doneShe wanted to save her brothers and had no key of the castle of theglassmountain so this faithful little sister took a knife out of herpocket and cut off her little finger that was just the size of thepiece of wood she had lost and put it in the door and opened it.As she went in a little dwarf came up to her and said What are youseeking for I seek for my brothers the seven ravens answered she.Then the dwarf said My masters are not at home but if you will waittill they come pray step in. Now the little dwarf was getting theirdinner ready and he brought their food upon seven little plates andtheir drink in seven little glasses and set them upon the table andout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece and out of eachlittle glass she drank a small drop but she let the ring that she hadbrought with her fall into the last glass.On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air and thedwarf said Here come my masters. When they came in they wanted toeat and drink and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then saidone after the otherWho has eaten from my little plate And who has been drinking out of mylittle glass Caw Caw well I ween  Mortal lips have this way been.When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass and found there thering he looked at it and knew that it was his fathers and mothersand said O that our little sister would but come then we should befree. When the little girl heard this for she stood behind the doorall the time and listened she ran forward and in an instant allthe ravens took their right form again and all hugged and kissed eachother and went merrily home.THE WEDDING OF MRS FOXFIRST STORYThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails who believed thathis wife was not faithful to him and wished to put her to the test.

Then he wanted to go his way butshe took hold of him and said Listen my friend to what I am goingto tell you I will reward you for your kindness go your way and aftera little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birdssitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them and one will fall downdead the cloak will fall too take it it is a wishingcloak and whenyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish tobe. Cut open the dead bird take out its heart and keep it and you willfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. Itis the birds heart that will bring you this good luck.The huntsman thanked her and thought to himself If all this doeshappen it will be a fine thing for me. When he had gone a hundredsteps or so he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over himand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their billsand feet screaming fighting and tugging at each other as ifeach wished to have it himself. Well said the huntsman this iswonderful this happens just as the old woman said then he shot intothe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went theflock chattering away but one fell down dead and the cloak with it.Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him cut open the bird tookout the heart and carried the cloak home with him.The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow and there laythe piece of gold glittering underneath the same happened next day andindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold andat last thought to himself Of what use is this gold to me whilst I amat home I will go out into the world and look about me.Then he took leave of his friends and hung his bag and bow about hisneck and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led througha thick wood at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadowand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful younglady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch andsaid to the young lady There is a young man coming out of the wood whocarries a wonderful prize we must get it away from him my dear childfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a birds heart thatbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning. Meantime thehuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady and said to himself Ihave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castleand rest myself for I have money enough to pay for anything I wantbut the real reason was that he wanted to see more of the beautifullady. Then he went into the house and was welcomed kindly and it wasnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing elsebut looking at the ladys eyes and doing everything that she wished.Then the old woman said Now is the time for getting the birds heart.So the lady stole it away and he never found any more gold under hispillow for it lay now under the young ladys and the old woman took itaway every morning but he was so much in love that he never missed hisprize.Well said the old witch we have got the birds heart but not thewishingcloak yet and that we must also get. Let us leave him thatsaid the young lady he has already lost his wealth. Then the witchwas very angry and said Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderfulthing and I must and will have it. So she did as the old woman toldher and set herself at the window and looked about the country andseemed very sorrowful then the huntsman said What makes you so sadAlas dear sir said she yonder lies the granite rock where all thecostly diamonds grow and I want so much to go there that whenever Ithink of it I cannot help being sorrowful for who can reach it onlythe birds and the fliesman cannot. If thats all your grief saidthe huntsman Ill take you there with all my heart so he drew her underhis cloak and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain theywere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they weredelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witchmade a deep sleep come upon him and he said to the young lady Let ussit down and rest ourselves a little I am so tired that I cannot standany longer. So they sat down and he laid his head in her lap andfell asleep and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak fromhis shoulders hung it on her own picked up the diamonds and wishedherself home again.When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him and left himalone on the wild rock he said Alas what roguery there is in theworld and there he sat in great grief and fear not knowing what todo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it and ashe saw three of them striding about he thought to himself I can onlysave myself by feigning to be asleep so he laid himself down as if hewere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him the first pushedhim with his foot and said What worm is this that lies here curledup Tread upon him and kill him said the second. Its not worth thetrouble said the third let him live hell go climbing higher up themountain and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away. And theypassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said and as soon as theywere gone he climbed to the top of the mountain and when he had satthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him and caught him in awhirlwind and bore him along for some time till it settled in a gardenand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.Then he looked around him and said I wish I had something to eat ifnot I shall be worse off than before for here I see neither applesnor pears nor any kind of fruits nothing but vegetables. At last hethought to himself I can eat salad it will refresh and strengthenme. So he picked out a fine head and ate of it but scarcely had heswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed and saw withhorror that he was turned into an ass. However he still felt veryhungry and the salad tasted very nice so he ate on till he cameto another kind of salad and scarcely had he tasted it when he feltanother change come over him and soon saw that he was lucky enough tohave found his old shape again.Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness andwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good andthe bad salad and thought to himself This will help me to my fortuneagain and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery. So hewent away to try and find the castle of his friends and after wanderingabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all overbrown so that even his mother would not have known him and went intothe castle and asked for a lodging I am so tired said he that Ican go no farther. Countryman said the witch who are you and whatis your business I am said he a messenger sent by the king tofind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been luckyenough to find it and have brought it with me but the heat of the sunscorches so that it begins to wither and I dont know that I can carryit farther.When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad theylonged to taste it and said Dear countryman let us just taste it.To be sure answered he I have two heads of it with me and willgive you one so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then thewitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed and when it wasready she could not wait till it was carried up but took a few leavesimmediately and put them in her mouth and scarcely were they swallowedwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in theform of an ass. Now the servantmaid came into the kitchen and seeingthe salad ready was going to carry it up but on the way she too felt awish to taste it as the old woman had done and ate some leaves so shealso was turned into an ass and ran after the other letting the dishwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time withthe beautiful young lady and as nobody came with the salad and shelonged to taste it she said I dont know where the salad can be.Then he thought something must have happened and said I will gointo the kitchen and see. And as he went he saw two asses in the courtrunning about and the salad lying on the ground. All right saidhe those two have had their share. Then he took up the rest ofthe leaves laid them on the dish and brought them to the young ladysaying I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.So she ate of it and like the others ran off into the court brayingaway.Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that theymight know him. Now you shall be paid for your roguery said he andtied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till hecame to a mill and knocked at the window. Whats the matter said themiller. I have three tiresome beasts here said the other if youwill take them give them food and room and treat them as I tell youI will pay you whatever you ask. With all my heart said the millerbut how shall I treat them Then the huntsman said Give the oldone stripes three times a day and hay once give the next who wasthe servantmaid stripes once a day and hay three times and givethe youngest who was the beautiful lady hay three times a day andno stripes for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.After this he went back to the castle where he found everything hewanted.Some days after the miller came to him and told him that the old asswas dead The other two said he are alive and eat but are sosorrowful that they cannot last long. Then the huntsman pitied themand told the miller to drive them back to him and when they came hegave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young ladyfell upon her knees before him and said O dearest huntsman forgiveme all the ill I have done you my mother forced me to it it wasagainst my will for I always loved you very much. Your wishingcloakhangs up in the closet and as for the birds heart I will give it youtoo. But he said Keep it it will be just the same thing for I meanto make you my wife. So they were married and lived together veryhappily till they died.THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WASA certain father had two sons the elder of who was smart and sensibleand could do everything but the younger was stupid and could neitherlearn nor understand anything and when people saw him they saidTheres a fellow who will give his father some trouble When anythinghad to be done it was always the elder who was forced to do it butif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late or in thenighttime and the way led through the churchyard or any other dismalplace he answered Oh no father Ill not go there it makes meshudder for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire atnight which made the flesh creep the listeners sometimes said Ohit makes us shudder The younger sat in a corner and listened withthe rest of them and could not imagine what they could mean. They arealways saying It makes me shudder it makes me shudder It does notmake me shudder thought he. That too must be an art of which Iunderstand nothingNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day Hearken to meyou fellow in the corner there you are growing tall and strong and youtoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how yourbrother works but you do not even earn your salt. Well father hereplied I am quite willing to learn somethingindeed if it could butbe managed I should like to learn how to shudder. I dont understandthat at all yet. The elder brother smiled when he heard that andthought to himself Goodness what a blockhead that brother of mine isHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives He who wants tobe a sickle must bend himself betimes.The father sighed and answered him You shall soon learn what it is toshudder but you will not earn your bread by that.Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit and the fatherbewailed his trouble and told him how his younger son was so backwardin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. Just thinksaid he when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread heactually wanted to learn to shudder. If that be all replied thesexton he can learn that with me. Send him to me and I will soonpolish him. The father was glad to do it for he thought It willtrain the boy a little. The sexton therefore took him into his houseand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two the sexton awokehim at midnight and bade him arise and go up into the church tower andring the bell. You shall soon learn what shuddering is thought heand secretly went there before him and when the boy was at the top ofthe tower and turned round and was just going to take hold of the bellrope he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the soundinghole. Who is there cried he but the figure made no reply and didnot move or stir. Give an answer cried the boy or take yourselfoff you have no business here at night.The sexton however remained standing motionless that the boy mightthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time What do you wantherespeak if you are an honest fellow or I will throw you down thesteps The sexton thought He cant mean to be as bad as his wordsuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boycalled to him for the third time and as that was also to no purposehe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs so that it felldown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon herang the bell went home and without saying a word went to bed andfell asleep. The sextons wife waited a long time for her husband buthe did not come back. At length she became uneasy and wakened the boyand asked Do you know where my husband is He climbed up the towerbefore you did. No I dont know replied the boy but someone wasstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps and as hewould neither give an answer nor go away I took him for a scoundreland threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.I should be sorry if it were. The woman ran away and found her husbandwho was lying moaning in the corner and had broken his leg.She carried him down and then with loud screams she hastened to theboys father Your boy cried she has been the cause of a greatmisfortune He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke hisleg. Take the goodfornothing fellow out of our house. The father wasterrified and ran thither and scolded the boy. What wicked tricksare these said he. The devil must have put them into your head.Father he replied do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He wasstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not knowwho it was and I entreated him three times either to speak or to goaway. Ah said the father I have nothing but unhappiness with you.Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.Yes father right willingly wait only until it is day. Then will Igo forth and learn how to shudder and then I shall at any rateunderstand one art which will support me. Learn what you will spokethe father it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.Take these and go into the wide world and tell no one from whence youcome and who is your father for I have reason to be ashamed of you.Yes father it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more thanthat I can easily keep it in mind.When the day dawned therefore the boy put his fifty talers into hispocket and went forth on the great highway and continually said tohimself If I could but shudder If I could but shudder Then a manapproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding withhimself and when they had walked a little farther to where they couldsee the gallows the man said to him Look there is the tree whereseven men have married the ropemakers daughter and are now learninghow to fly. Sit down beneath it and wait till night comes and you willsoon learn how to shudder. If that is all that is wanted answeredthe youth it is easily done but if I learn how to shudder as fast asthat you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in themorning. Then the youth went to the gallows sat down beneath it andwaited till evening came. And as he was cold he lighted himself a firebut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire hecould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against eachother and they moved backwards and forwards he thought to himselfIf you shiver below by the fire how those up above must freeze andsuffer And as he felt pity for them he raised the ladder and climbedup unbound one of them after the other and brought down all seven.Then he stoked the fire blew it and set them all round it to warmthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir and the fire caughttheir clothes. So he said Take care or I will hang you up again. Thedead men however did not hear but were quite silent and let theirrags go on burning. At this he grew angry and said If you will nottake care I cannot help you I will not be burnt with you and he hungthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fellasleep and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to havethe fifty talers and said Well do you know how to shudder Noanswered he how should I know Those fellows up there did not opentheir mouths and were so stupid that they let the few old rags whichthey had on their bodies get burnt. Then the man saw that he would notget the fifty talers that day and went away saying Such a youth hasnever come my way before.The youth likewise went his way and once more began to mutter tohimself Ah if I could but shudder Ah if I could but shudder Awaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked Who areyou I dont know answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked Fromwhence do you come I know not. Who is your father That I maynot tell you. What is it that you are always muttering between yourteeth Ah replied the youth I do so wish I could shudder butno one can teach me how. Enough of your foolish chatter said thewaggoner. Come go with me I will see about a place for you. Theyouth went with the waggoner and in the evening they arrived at an innwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlourthe youth again said quite loudly If I could but shudder If I couldbut shudder The host who heard this laughed and said If that isyour desire there ought to be a good opportunity for you here. Ahbe silent said the hostess so many prying persons have already losttheir lives it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes asthese should never see the daylight again.But the youth said However difficult it may be I will learn it. Forthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth. He let the host haveno rest until the latter told him that not far from thence stood ahaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering wasif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised thathe who would venture should have his daughter to wife and she was themost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay greattreasures which were guarded by evil spirits and these treasures wouldthen be freed and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many menhad gone into the castle but as yet none had come out again. Then theyouth went next morning to the king and said If it be allowed I willwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.The king looked at him and as the youth pleased him he said You mayask for three things to take into the castle with you but they mustbe things without life. Then he answered Then I ask for a fire aturning lathe and a cuttingboard with the knife.The king had these things carried into the castle for him during theday. When night was drawing near the youth went up and made himselfa bright fire in one of the rooms placed the cuttingboard and knifebeside it and seated himself by the turninglathe. Ah if I couldbut shudder said he but I shall not learn it here either. Towardsmidnight he was about to poke his fire and as he was blowing itsomething cried suddenly from one corner Au miau how cold we areYou fools cried he what are you crying about If you are cold comeand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves. And when he had saidthat two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat downon each side of him and looked savagely at him with their fieryeyes. After a short time when they had warmed themselves they saidComrade shall we have a game of cards Why not he replied butjust show me your paws. Then they stretched out their claws. Oh saidhe what long nails you have Wait I must first cut them for you.Thereupon he seized them by the throats put them on the cuttingboardand screwed their feet fast. I have looked at your fingers said heand my fancy for cardplaying has gone and he struck them dead andthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these twoand was about to sit down again by his fire out from every hole andcorner came black cats and black dogs with redhot chains and moreand more of them came until he could no longer move and they yelledhorribly and got on his fire pulled it to pieces and tried to putit out. He watched them for a while quietly but at last when they weregoing too far he seized his cuttingknife and cried Away with youvermin and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away the othershe killed and threw out into the fishpond. When he came back he fannedthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat hiseyes would keep open no longer and he felt a desire to sleep. Then helooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. That is the very thingfor me said he and got into it. When he was just going to shut hiseyes however the bed began to move of its own accord and went overthe whole of the castle. Thats right said he but go faster. Thenthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it up and downover thresholds and stairs but suddenly hop hop it turned over upsidedown and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows upin the air got out and said Now anyone who likes may drive andlay down by his fire and slept till it was day. In the morning the kingcame and when he saw him lying there on the ground he thought the evilspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he After all it is apityfor so handsome a man. The youth heard it got up and said Ithas not come to that yet. Then the king was astonished but very gladand asked how he had fared. Very well indeed answered he onenight is past the two others will pass likewise. Then he went to theinnkeeper who opened his eyes very wide and said I never expected tosee you alive again Have you learnt how to shudder yet No said heit is all in vain. If someone would but tell meThe second night he again went up into the old castle sat down by thefire and once more began his old song If I could but shudder Whenmidnight came an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard atfirst it was low but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet fora while and at length with a loud scream half a man came down thechimney and fell before him. Hullo cried he another half belongsto this. This is not enough Then the uproar began again there was aroaring and howling and the other half fell down likewise. Wait saidhe I will just stoke up the fire a little for you. When he had donethat and looked round again the two pieces were joined together and ahideous man was sitting in his place. That is no part of our bargainsaid the youth the bench is mine. The man wanted to push him awaythe youth however would not allow that but thrust him off with allhis strength and seated himself again in his own place. Then still moremen fell down one after the other they brought nine dead mens legsand two skulls and set them up and played at ninepins with them. Theyouth also wanted to play and said Listen you can I join you Yesif you have any money. Money enough replied he but your balls arenot quite round. Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe andturned them till they were round. There now they will roll bettersaid he. Hurrah now well have fun He played with them and lost someof his money but when it struck twelve everything vanished from hissight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king cameto inquire after him. How has it fared with you this time asked he.I have been playing at ninepins he answered and have lost a coupleof farthings. Have you not shuddered then What said he I havehad a wonderful time If I did but know what it was to shudderThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadlyIf I could but shudder. When it grew late six tall men came in andbrought a coffin. Then he said Ha ha that is certainly my littlecousin who died only a few days ago and he beckoned with his fingerand cried Come little cousin come. They placed the coffin on theground but he went to it and took the lid off and a dead man laytherein. He felt his face but it was cold as ice. Wait said he Iwill warm you a little and went to the fire and warmed his hand andlaid it on the dead mans face but he remained cold. Then he took himout and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed hisarms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good hethought to himself When two people lie in bed together they warm eachother and carried him to the bed covered him over and lay down byhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too and began to move.Then said the youth See little cousin have I not warmed you Thedead man however got up and cried Now will I strangle you.What said he is that the way you thank me You shall at once gointo your coffin again and he took him up threw him into it and shutthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. I cannotmanage to shudder said he. I shall never learn it here as long as Ilive.Then a man entered who was taller than all others and looked terrible.He was old however and had a long white beard. You wretch cried heyou shall soon learn what it is to shudder for you shall die. Not sofast replied the youth. If I am to die I shall have to have a sayin it. I will soon seize you said the fiend. Softly softly do nottalk so big. I am as strong as you are and perhaps even stronger.We shall see said the old man. If you are stronger I will let yougocome we will try. Then he led him by dark passages to a smithsforge took an axe and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.I can do better than that said the youth and went to the otheranvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on and hiswhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe split the anvilwith one blow and in it caught the old mans beard. Now I have yousaid the youth. Now it is your turn to die. Then he seized an iron barand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop when hewould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.The old man led him back into the castle and in a cellar showed himthree chests full of gold. Of these said he one part is for thepoor the other for the king the third yours. In the meantime itstruck twelve and the spirit disappeared so that the youth stood indarkness. I shall still be able to find my way out said he and feltabout found the way into the room and slept there by his fire.Next morning the king came and said Now you must have learnt whatshuddering is No he answered what can it be My dead cousin washere and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money downbelow but no one told me what it was to shudder. Then said theking you have saved the castle and shall marry my daughter. Thatis all very well said he but still I do not know what it is toshudderThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated but howsoevermuch the young king loved his wife and however happy he was he stillsaid always If I could but shudderif I could but shudder. And thisat last angered her. Her waitingmaid said I will find a cure for himhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder. She went out to the streamwhich flowed through the garden and had a whole bucketful of gudgeonsbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping his wife wasto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold waterwith the gudgeons in it over him so that the little fishes wouldsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried Oh what makes me shuddersowhat makes me shudder so dear wife Ah now I know what it is toshudderKING GRISLYBEARDA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was verybeautiful but so proud and haughty and conceited that none of theprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her and sheonly made sport of them.Once upon a time the king held a great feast and asked thither allher suitors and they all sat in a row ranged according to theirrankkings and princes and dukes and earls and counts and baronsand knights. Then the princess came in and as she passed by them shehad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat Hesas round as a tub said she. The next was too tall What a maypolesaid she. The next was too short What a dumpling said she. Thefourth was too pale and she called him Wallface. The fifth was toored so she called him Coxcomb. The sixth was not straight enoughso she said he was like a green stick that had been laid to dry overa bakers oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one butshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. Look athim said she his beard is like an old mop he shall be calledGrislybeard. So the king got the nickname of Grislybeard.But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behavedand how she illtreated all his guests and he vowed that willing orunwilling she should marry the first man be he prince or beggar thatcame to the door.Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler who began to playunder the window and beg alms and when the king heard him he saidLet him come in. So they brought in a dirtylooking fellow and whenhe had sung before the king and the princess he begged a boon. Then theking said You have sung so well that I will give you my daughter foryour wife. The princess begged and prayed but the king said I havesworn to give you to the first comer and I will keep my word. So wordsand tears were of no avail the parson was sent for and she was marriedto the fiddler. When this was over the king said Now get ready togoyou must not stay hereyou must travel on with your husband.Then the fiddler went his way and took her with him and they soon cameto a great wood. Pray said she whose is this wood It belongsto King Grislybeard answered he hadst thou taken him all had beenthine. Ah unlucky wretch that I am sighed she would that I hadmarried King Grislybeard Next they came to some fine meadows. Whoseare these beautiful green meadows said she. They belong to KingGrislybeard hadst thou taken him they had all been thine. Ahunlucky wretch that I am said she would that I had married KingGrislybeardThen they came to a great city. Whose is this noble city said she.It belongs to King Grislybeard hadst thou taken him it had all beenthine. Ah wretch that I am sighed she why did I not marry KingGrislybeard That is no business of mine said the fiddler whyshould you wish for another husband Am not I good enough for youAt last they came to a small cottage. What a paltry place said sheto whom does that little dirty hole belong Then the fiddler saidThat is your and my house where we are to live. Where are yourservants cried she. What do we want with servants said he youmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire and puton water and cook my supper for I am very tired. But the princess knewnothing of making fires and cooking and the fiddler was forced to helpher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed but thefiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thusthey lived for two days and when they had eaten up all there was in thecottage the man said Wife we cant go on thus spending money andearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets. Then he went out andcut willows and brought them home and she began to weave but it madeher fingers very sore. I see this work wont do said he try andspin perhaps you will do that better. So she sat down and tried tospin but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. Seenow said the fiddler you are good for nothing you can do no workwhat a bargain I have got However Ill try and set up a trade in potsand pans and you shall stand in the market and sell them. Alassighed she if any of my fathers court should pass by and see mestanding in the market how they will laugh at meBut her husband did not care for that and said she must work if shedid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well for manypeople seeing such a beautiful woman went to buy her wares and paidtheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived onthis as long as it lasted and then her husband bought a fresh lot ofware and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market buta drunken soldier soon came by and rode his horse against her stalland broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cryand knew not what to do. Ah what will become of me said she whatwill my husband say So she ran home and told him all. Who wouldhave thought you would have been so silly said he as to put anearthenware stall in the corner of the market where everybody passesbut let us have no more crying I see you are not fit for this sort ofwork so I have been to the kings palace and asked if they did notwant a kitchenmaid and they say they will take you and there you willhave plenty to eat.Thus the princess became a kitchenmaid and helped the cook to do allthe dirtiest work but she was allowed to carry home some of the meatthat was left and on this they lived.She had not been there long before she heard that the kings eldest sonwas passing by going to be married and she went to one of the windowsand looked out. Everything was ready and all the pomp and brightness ofthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and follywhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the richmeats which she put into her basket to take home.All on a sudden as she was going out in came the kings son in goldenclothes and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door he took herby the hand and said she should be his partner in the dance but shetrembled for fear for she saw that it was King Grislybeard who wasmaking sport of her. However he kept fast hold and led her in and thecover of the basket came off so that the meats in it fell about. Theneverybody laughed and jeered at her and she was so abashed that shewished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to thedoor to run away but on the steps King Grislybeard overtook her andbrought her back and said Fear me not I am the fiddler who has livedwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. Iam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this onlyto cure you of your silly pride and to show you the folly of yourilltreatment of me. Now all is over you have learnt wisdom and it istime to hold our marriage feast.Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes andher father and his whole court were there already and welcomed her homeon her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast wasgrand they danced and sang all were merry and I only wish that youand I had been of the party.IRON HANSThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near hispalace full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out ahuntsman to shoot him a roe but he did not come back. Perhaps someaccident has befallen him said the king and the next day he sent outtwo more huntsmen who were to search for him but they too stayed away.Then on the third day he sent for all his huntsmen and said Scourthe whole forest through and do not give up until you have found allthree. But of these also none came home again none were seen again.From that time forth no one would any longer venture into the forestand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude and nothing was seenof it but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted formany years when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king asseeking a situation and offered to go into the dangerous forest. Theking however would not give his consent and said It is not safe inthere I fear it would fare with you no better than with the othersand you would never come out again. The huntsman replied Lord I willventure it at my own risk of fear I know nothing.The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It wasnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way and wanted topursue it but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before adeep pool could go no farther and a naked arm stretched itself out ofthe water seized it and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that hewent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out thewater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose bodywas brown like rusty iron and whose hair hung over his face down to hisknees. They bound him with cords and led him away to the castle. Therewas great astonishment over the wild man the king however had him putin an iron cage in his courtyard and forbade the door to be openedon pain of death and the queen herself was to take the key into herkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into theforest with safety.The king had a son of eight years who was once playing in thecourtyard and while he was playing his golden ball fell into the cage.The boy ran thither and said Give me my ball out. Not till you haveopened the door for me answered the man. No said the boy I willnot do that the king has forbidden it and ran away. The next day heagain went and asked for his ball the wild man said Open my doorbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out huntingand the boy went once more and said I cannot open the door even if Iwished for I have not the key. Then the wild man said It lies underyour mothers pillow you can get it there. The boy who wanted to havehis ball back cast all thought to the winds and brought the key. Thedoor opened with difficulty and the boy pinched his fingers. When itwas open the wild man stepped out gave him the golden ball and hurriedaway. The boy had become afraid he called and cried after him Ohwild man do not go away or I shall be beaten The wild man turnedback took him up set him on his shoulder and went with hasty stepsinto the forest. When the king came home he observed the empty cageand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about itand sought the key but it was gone. She called the boy but no oneanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields butthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened andmuch grief reigned in the royal court.When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest he took the boydown from his shoulder and said to him You will never see your fatherand mother again but I will keep you with me for you have set me freeand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you you shall farewell. Of treasure and gold have I enough and more than anyone in theworld. He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept and thenext morning the man took him to a well and said Behold the goldwell is as bright and clear as crystal you shall sit beside it andtake care that nothing falls into it or it will be polluted. I willcome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order. The boy placedhimself by the brink of the well and often saw a golden fish or agolden snake show itself therein and took care that nothing fell in.As he was thus sitting his finger hurt him so violently that heinvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again but sawthat it was quite gilded and whatsoever pains he took to wash the goldoff again all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came backlooked at the boy and said What has happened to the well Nothingnothing he answered and held his finger behind his back that theman might not see it. But he said You have dipped your finger intothe water this time it may pass but take care you do not again letanything go in. By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well andwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his headand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quicklyout but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came and already knewwhat had happened. You have let a hair fall into the well said he.I will allow you to watch by it once more but if this happens for thethird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain withme.On the third day the boy sat by the well and did not stir his fingerhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him and he looked atthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as hestill bent down more and more while he was doing so and trying to lookstraight into the eyes his long hair fell down from his shoulders intothe water. He raised himself up quickly but the whole of the hair ofhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine howterrified the poor boy was He took his pockethandkerchief and tied itround his head in order that the man might not see it. When he came healready knew everything and said Take the handkerchief off. Then thegolden hair streamed forth and let the boy excuse himself as he mightit was of no use. You have not stood the trial and can stay here nolonger. Go forth into the world there you will learn what poverty is.But as you have not a bad heart and as I mean well by you there isone thing I will grant you if you fall into any difficulty come to theforest and cry Iron Hans and then I will come and help you. Mypower is great greater than you think and I have gold and silver inabundance.Then the kings son left the forest and walked by beaten and unbeatenpaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There helooked for work but could find none and he learnt nothing by which hecould help himself. At length he went to the palace and asked if theywould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what usethey could make of him but they liked him and told him to stay. Atlength the cook took him into his service and said he might carry woodand water and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened thatno one else was at hand the cook ordered him to carry the food to theroyal table but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen hekept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come underthe kings notice and he said When you come to the royal table youmust take your hat off. He answered Ah Lord I cannot I have a badsore place on my head. Then the king had the cook called before himand scolded him and asked how he could take such a boy as that into hisservice and that he was to send him away at once. The cook howeverhad pity on him and exchanged him for the gardeners boy.And now the boy had to plant and water the garden hoe and dig and bearthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone inthe garden the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the airmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed sothat the rays fell into the bedroom of the kings daughter and up shesprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy and cried tohim Boy bring me a wreath of flowers. He put his cap on with allhaste and gathered wild fieldflowers and bound them together. When hewas ascending the stairs with them the gardener met him and said Howcan you take the kings daughter a garland of such common flowers Goquickly and get another and seek out the prettiest and rarest. Ohno replied the boy the wild ones have more scent and will pleaseher better. When he got into the room the kings daughter said Takeyour cap off it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence. He againsaid I may not I have a sore head. She however caught at hiscap and pulled it off and then his golden hair rolled down on hisshoulders and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out but sheheld him by the arm and gave him a handful of ducats. With these hedeparted but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to thegardener and said I present them to your children they can play withthem. The following day the kings daughter again called to him that hewas to bring her a wreath of fieldflowers and then he went in with itshe instantly snatched at his cap and wanted to take it away from himbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful ofducats but he would not keep them and gave them to the gardener forplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just thesame she could not get his cap away from him and he would not have hermoney.Not long afterwards the country was overrun by war. The king gatheredtogether his people and did not know whether or not he could offer anyopposition to the enemy who was superior in strength and had a mightyarmy. Then said the gardeners boy I am grown up and will go to thewars also only give me a horse. The others laughed and said Seekone for yourself when we are gone we will leave one behind us in thestable for you. When they had gone forth he went into the stable andled the horse out it was lame of one foot and limped hobblety jibhobblety jib nevertheless he mounted it and rode away to the darkforest. When he came to the outskirts he called Iron Hans threetimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild manappeared immediately and said What do you desire I want a strongsteed for I am going to the wars. That you shall have and still morethan you ask for. Then the wild man went back into the forest and itwas not long before a stableboy came out of it who led a horse thatsnorted with its nostrils and could hardly be restrained and behindthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron andtheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his threeleggedhorse to the stableboy mounted the other and rode at the head of thesoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the kingsmen had already fallen and little was wanting to make the rest giveway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers broke likea hurricane over the enemy and beat down all who opposed him. Theybegan to flee but the youth pursued and never stopped until therewas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king however heconducted his troop by byways back to the forest and called forth IronHans. What do you desire asked the wild man. Take back your horseand your troops and give me my threelegged horse again. All that heasked was done and soon he was riding on his threelegged horse. Whenthe king returned to his palace his daughter went to meet him andwished him joy of his victory. I am not the one who carried away thevictory said he but a strange knight who came to my assistance withhis soldiers. The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight wasbut the king did not know and said He followed the enemy and I didnot see him again. She inquired of the gardener where his boy was buthe smiled and said He has just come home on his threelegged horseand the others have been mocking him and crying Here comes ourhobblety jib back again They asked too Under what hedge have youbeen lying sleeping all the time So he said I did the best of alland it would have gone badly without me. And then he was still moreridiculed.The king said to his daughter I will proclaim a great feast that shalllast for three days and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps theunknown man will show himself. When the feast was announced the youthwent out to the forest and called Iron Hans. What do you desireasked he. That I may catch the kings daughters golden apple. It isas safe as if you had it already said Iron Hans. You shall likewisehave a suit of red armour for the occasion and ride on a spiritedchestnuthorse. When the day came the youth galloped to the spot tookhis place amongst the knights and was recognized by no one. The kingsdaughter came forward and threw a golden apple to the knights but noneof them caught it but he only as soon as he had it he galloped away.On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight and gave hima white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple andhe did not linger an instant but galloped off with it. The king grewangry and said That is not allowed he must appear before me and tellhis name. He gave the order that if the knight who caught the appleshould go away again they should pursue him and if he would not comeback willingly they were to cut him down and stab him.On the third day he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour anda black horse and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding offwith it the kings attendants pursued him and one of them got so nearhim that he wounded the youths leg with the point of his sword. Theyouth nevertheless escaped from them but his horse leapt so violentlythat the helmet fell from the youths head and they could see that hehad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.The following day the kings daughter asked the gardener about hisboy. He is at work in the garden the queer creature has been at thefestival too and only came home yesterday evening he has likewiseshown my children three golden apples which he has won.The king had him summoned into his presence and he came and again hadhis little cap on his head. But the kings daughter went up to him andtook it off and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders andhe was so handsome that all were amazed. Are you the knight who cameevery day to the festival always in different colours and who caughtthe three golden apples asked the king. Yes answered he and herethe apples are and he took them out of his pocket and returned themto the king. If you desire further proof you may see the wound whichyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knightwho helped you to your victory over your enemies. If you can performsuch deeds as that you are no gardeners boy tell me who is yourfather My father is a mighty king and gold have I in plenty as greatas I require. I well see said the king that I owe my thanks toyou can I do anything to please you Yes answered he that indeedyou can. Give me your daughter to wife. The maiden laughed and saidHe does not stand much on ceremony but I have already seen by hisgolden hair that he was no gardeners boy and then she went andkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding and were in greatdelight for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dearson again. And as they were sitting at the marriagefeast the musicsuddenly stopped the doors opened and a stately king came in with agreat retinue. He went up to the youth embraced him and said I amIron Hans and was by enchantment a wild man but you have set me freeall the treasures which I possess shall be your property.CATSKINThere was once a king whose queen had hair of the purest gold and wasso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face ofthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill and when she felt that herend drew near she called the king to her and said Promise me that youwill never marry again unless you meet with a wife who is as beautifulas I am and who has golden hair like mine. Then when the king in hisgrief promised all she asked she shut her eyes and died. But the kingwas not to be comforted and for a long time never thought of takinganother wife. At last however his wise men said this will not dothe king must marry again that we may have a queen. So messengers weresent far and wide to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.But there was no princess in the world so beautiful and if there hadbeen still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So themessengers came home and had had all their trouble for nothing.Now the king had a daughter who was just as beautiful as her motherand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up the king lookedat her and saw that she was just like this late queen then he said tohis courtiers May I not marry my daughter She is the very image of mydead wife unless I have her I shall not find any bride upon the wholeearth and you say there must be a queen. When the courtiers heard thisthey were shocked and said Heaven forbid that a father should marryhis daughter Out of so great a sin no good can come. And his daughterwas also shocked but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughtsso she said to him Before I marry anyone I must have three dressesone must be of gold like the sun another must be of shining silverlike the moon and a third must be dazzling as the stars besides thisI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together towhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin. And thusshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made themost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses one goldenlike the sun another silvery like the moon and a third sparklinglike the stars and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts inhis kingdom and to take the finest fur out of their skins and thus amantle of a thousand furs was made.When all were ready the king sent them to her but she got up in thenight when all were asleep and took three of her trinkets a goldenring a golden necklace and a golden brooch and packed the threedressesof the sun the moon and the starsup in a nutshell andwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur and besmearedher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven forhelp in her need and went away and journeyed on the whole night tillat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired she sat herselfdown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep and there she slepton till it was midday.Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it his dogscame to the tree and began to snuff about and run round and round andbark. Look sharp said the king to the huntsmen and see what sortof game lies there. And the huntsmen went up to the tree and when theycame back again said In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderfulbeast such as we never saw before its skin seems to be of a thousandkinds of fur but there it lies fast asleep. See said the king ifyou can catch it alive and we will take it with us. So the huntsmentook it up and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened and saidI am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left have pity onme and take me with you. Then they said Yes Miss Catskin you willdo for the kitchen you can sweep up the ashes and do things of thatsort. So they put her into the coach and took her home to the kingspalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase whereno light of day ever peeped in and said Catskin you may lie andsleep there. And she was sent into the kitchen and made to fetch woodand water to blow the fire pluck the poultry pick the herbs sift theashes and do all the dirty work.Thus Catskin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. Ah prettyprincess thought she what will now become of thee But it happenedone day that a feast was to be held in the kings castle so she said tothe cook May I go up a little while and see what is going on I willtake care and stand behind the door. And the cook said Yes you maygo but be back again in half an hours time to rake out the ashes.Then she took her little lamp and went into her cabin and took off thefur skin and washed the soot from off her face and hands so that herbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next openedher nutshell and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sunand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her for nobody knewher and they thought she could be no less than a kings daughter. Butthe king came up to her and held out his hand and danced with her andhe thought in his heart I never saw any one half so beautiful.When the dance was at an end she curtsied and when the king lookedround for her she was gone no one knew wither. The guards that stoodat the castle gate were called in but they had seen no one. The truthwas that she had run into her little cabin pulled off her dressblackened her face and hands put on the furskin cloak and wasCatskin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work and beganto rake the ashes the cook said Let that alone till the morning andheat the kings soup I should like to run up now and give a peep buttake care you dont let a hair fall into it or you will run a chance ofnever eating again.As soon as the cook went away Catskin heated the kings soup andtoasted a slice of bread first as nicely as ever she could and when itwas ready she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ringand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was overthe king ordered his soup to be brought in and it pleased him so wellthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottomhe saw a gold ring lying and as he could not make out how it had gotthere he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened whenhe heard the order and said to Catskin You must have let a hair fallinto the soup if it be so you will have a good beating. Then he wentbefore the king and he asked him who had cooked the soup. I didanswered the cook. But the king said That is not true it was betterdone than you could do it. Then he answered To tell the truth I didnot cook it but Catskin did. Then let Catskin come up said theking and when she came he said to her Who are you I am a poorchild said she that has lost both father and mother. How came youin my palace asked he. I am good for nothing said she but to besculliongirl and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head. But howdid you get the ring that was in the soup asked the king. Then shewould not own that she knew anything about the ring so the king senther away again about her business.After a time there was another feast and Catskin asked the cook to lether go up and see it as before. Yes said he but come again in halfan hour and cook the king the soup that he likes so much. Then sheran to her little cabin washed herself quickly and took her dressout which was silvery as the moon and put it on and when she went inlooking like a kings daughter the king went up to her and rejoiced atseeing her again and when the dance began he danced with her. After thedance was at an end she managed to slip out so slyly that the king didnot see where she was gone but she sprang into her little cabin andmade herself into Catskin again and went into the kitchen to cook thesoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs she got the golden necklace anddropped it into the soup then it was brought to the king who ate itand it pleased him as well as before so he sent for the cook whowas again forced to tell him that Catskin had cooked it. Catskin wasbrought again before the king but she still told him that she was onlyfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the thirdtime it happened just the same as before. You must be a witchCatskin said the cook for you always put something into your soupso that it pleases the king better than mine. However he let her go upas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars andwent into the ballroom in it and the king danced with her again andthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilsthe was dancing with her he put a gold ring on her finger without herseeing it and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.When it was at an end he would have held her fast by the hand but sheslipped away and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sightof her and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin underthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long and stayed beyond thehalfhour so she had not time to take off her fine dress and threw herfur mantle over it and in her haste did not blacken herself all overwith soot but left one of her fingers white.Then she ran into the kitchen and cooked the kings soup and as soonas the cook was gone she put the golden brooch into the dish. When theking got to the bottom he ordered Catskin to be called once more andsoon saw the white finger and the ring that he had put on it whilstthey were dancing so he seized her hand and kept fast hold of it andwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away the fur cloak fell offa little on one side and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off and her golden hair andbeautiful form were seen and she could no longer hide herself so shewashed the soot and ashes from her face and showed herself to be themost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king saidYou are my beloved bride and we will never more be parted from eachother. And the wedding feast was held and a merry day it was as everwas heard of or seen in that country or indeed in any other.SNOWWHITE AND ROSEREDThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front ofthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rosetrees one of which borewhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like thetwo rosetrees and one was called Snowwhite and the other Rosered.They were as good and happy as busy and cheerful as ever two childrenin the world were only Snowwhite was more quiet and gentle thanRosered. Rosered liked better to run about in the meadows and fieldsseeking flowers and catching butterflies but Snowwhite sat at homewith her mother and helped her with her housework or read to her whenthere was nothing to do.The two children were so fond of one another that they always held eachother by the hand when they went out together and when Snowwhite saidWe will not leave each other Rosered answered Never so long as welive and their mother would add What one has she must share with theother.They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries and nobeasts did them any harm but came close to them trustfully. The littlehare would eat a cabbageleaf out of their hands the roe grazed bytheir side the stag leapt merrily by them and the birds sat still uponthe boughs and sang whatever they knew.No mishap overtook them if they had stayed too late in the forest andnight came on they laid themselves down near one another upon the mossand slept until morning came and their mother knew this and did notworry on their account.Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had rousedthem they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting neartheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them but said nothingand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found thatthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice and would certainlyhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few pacesfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel whowatches over good children.Snowwhite and Rosered kept their mothers little cottage so neat thatit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rosered took careof the house and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mothersbed before she awoke in which was a rose from each tree. In the winterSnowwhite lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettlewas of brass and shone like gold so brightly was it polished. In theevening when the snowflakes fell the mother said Go Snowwhite andbolt the door and then they sat round the hearth and the mother tookher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book and the two girlslistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon thefloor and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its headhidden beneath its wings.One evening as they were thus sitting comfortably together someoneknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother saidQuick Rosered open the door it must be a traveller who is seekingshelter. Rosered went and pushed back the bolt thinking that it was apoor man but it was not it was a bear that stretched his broad blackhead within the door.Rosered screamed and sprang back the lamb bleated the dove flutteredand Snowwhite hid herself behind her mothers bed. But the bear beganto speak and said Do not be afraid I will do you no harm I amhalffrozen and only want to warm myself a little beside you.Poor bear said the mother lie down by the fire only take care thatyou do not burn your coat. Then she cried Snowwhite Rosered comeout the bear will do you no harm he means well. So they both cameout and byandby the lamb and dove came nearer and were not afraidof him. The bear said Here children knock the snow out of my coat alittle so they brought the broom and swept the bears hide cleanan\n"

grow ripe it was found that every night oneof them was gone', 'The king became very angry at this and ordered thegardener to keep watch all night under the tree', 'The gardener set hiseldest son to watch but about twelve oclock he fell asleep and inthe morning another of the apples was missing', 'Then the second son wasordered to watch and at midnight he too fell asleep and in the morninganother apple was gone', 'Then the third son offered to keep watch butthe gardener at first would not let him for fear some harm should cometo him however at last he consented and the young man laid himselfunder the tree to watch', 'As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustlingnoise in the air and a bird came flying that was of pure gold and asit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak the gardeners sonjumped up and shot an arrow at it', 'But the arrow did the bird no harmonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail and then flew away.The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning and all thecouncil was called together', 'Everyone agreed that it was worth more thanall the wealth of the kingdom but the king said One feather is of nouse to me I must have the whole bird.Then the gardeners eldest son set out and thought to find the goldenbird very easily and when he had gone but a little way he came to awood and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting so he took hisbow and made ready to shoot at it', 'Then the fox said Do not shoot mefor I will give you good counsel I know what your business is andthat you want to find the golden bird', 'You will reach a village in theevening and when you get there you will see two inns opposite to eachother one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at go not inthere but rest for the night in the other though it may appear to youto be very poor and mean', 'But the son thought to himself What cansuch a beast as this know about the matter So he shot his arrow atthe fox but he missed it and it set up its tail above its back andran into the wood', 'Then he went his way and in the evening came tothe village where the two inns were and in one of these were peoplesinging and dancing and feasting but the other looked very dirtyand poor', 'I should be very silly said he if I went to that shabbyhouse and left this charming place so he went into the smart houseand ate and drank at his ease and forgot the bird and his country too.Time passed on and as the eldest son did not come back and no tidingswere heard of him the second son set out and the same thing happenedto him', 'He met the fox who gave him the good advice but when he cameto the two inns his eldest brother was standing at the window wherethe merrymaking was and called to him to come in and he could notwithstand the temptation but went in and forgot the golden bird andhis country in the same manner.Time passed on again and the youngest son too wished to set out intothe wide world to seek for the golden bird but his father would notlisten to it for a long while for he was very fond of his son andwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also and prevent hiscoming back', 'However at last it was agreed he should go for he wouldnot rest at home and as he came to the wood he met the fox and heardthe same good counsel', 'But he was thankful to the fox and did notattempt his life as his brothers had done so the fox said Sit upon mytail and you will travel faster', 'So he sat down and the fox began torun and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hairwhistled in the wind.When they came to the village the son followed the foxs counsel andwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there allnight at his ease', 'In the morning came the fox again and met him as hewas beginning his journey and said Go straight forward till you cometo a castle before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep andsnoring take no notice of them but go into the castle and pass on andon till you come to a room where the golden bird sits in a wooden cageclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage but do not try to take thebird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one otherwiseyou will repent it', 'Then the fox stretched out his tail again and theyoung man sat himself down and away they went over stock and stone tilltheir hair whistled in the wind.Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said so the son went inand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage andbelow stood the golden cage and the three golden apples that had beenlost were lying close by it', 'Then thought he to himself It will be avery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage sohe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke andthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king', 'The next morningthe court sat to judge him and when all was heard it sentenced him todie unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run asswiftly as the wind and if he did this he was to have the golden birdgiven him for his own.So he set out once more on his journey sighing and in great despairwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him and said You see nowwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel', 'I willstill however tell you how to find the golden horse if you will do asI bid you', 'You must go straight on till you come to the castle where thehorse stands in his stall by his side will lie the groom fast asleepand snoring take away the horse quietly but be sure to put the oldleathern saddle upon him and not the golden one that is close by it.Then the son sat down on the foxs tail and away they went over stockand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.All went right and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the goldensaddle', 'But when the son looked at the horse he thought it a great pityto put the leathern saddle upon it', 'I will give him the good onesaid he I am sure he deserves it', 'As he took up the golden saddle thegroom awoke and cried out so loud that all the guards ran in and tookhim prisoner and in the morning he was again brought before the courtto be judged and was sentenced to die', 'But it was agreed that if hecould bring thither the beautiful princess he should live and have thebird and the horse given him for his own.Then he went his way very sorrowful but the old fox came and said Whydid not you listen to me If you had you would have carried awayboth the bird and the horse yet will I once more give you counsel', 'Gostraight on and in the evening you will arrive at a castle', 'At twelveoclock at night the princess goes to the bathinghouse go up to herand give her a kiss and she will let you lead her away but take careyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.Then the fox stretched out his tail and so away they went over stockand stone till their hair whistled again.As they came to the castle all was as the fox had said and at twelveoclock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her thekiss and she agreed to run away with him but begged with many tearsthat he would let her take leave of her father', 'At first he refusedbut she wept still more and more and fell at his feet till at lasthe consented but the moment she came to her fathers house the guardsawoke and he was taken prisoner again.Then he was brought before the king and the king said You shall neverhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stopsthe view from my window', 'Now this hill was so big that the whole worldcould not take it away and when he had worked for seven days and haddone very little the fox came and said', 'Lie down and go to sleep Iwill work for you', 'And in the morning he awoke and the hill was goneso he went merrily to the king and told him that now that it wasremoved he must give him the princess.Then the king was obliged to keep his word and away went the young manand the princess and the fox came and said to him We will have allthree the princess the horse and the bird', 'Ah said the young manthat would be a great thing but how can you contrive itIf you will only listen said the fox it can be done', 'When you cometo the king and he asks for the beautiful princess you must say Hereshe is Then he will be very joyful and you will mount the goldenhorse that they are to give you and put out your hand to take leave ofthem but shake hands with the princess last', 'Then lift her quickly onto the horse behind you clap your spurs to his side and gallop away asfast as you can.All went right then the fox said When you come to the castle wherethe bird is I will stay with the princess at the door and you willride in and speak to the king and when he sees that it is the righthorse he will bring out the bird but you must sit still and say thatyou want to look at it to see whether it is the true golden bird andwhen you get it into your hand ride away.This too happened as the fox said they carried off the bird theprincess mounted again and they rode on to a great wood', 'Then the foxcame and said Pray kill me and cut off my head and my feet', 'But theyoung man refused to do it so the fox said I will at any rate giveyou good counsel beware of two things ransom no one from the gallowsand sit down by the side of no river', 'Then away he went', 'Wellthought the young man it is no hard matter to keep that advice.He rode on with the princess till at last he came to the village wherehe had left his two brothers', 'And there he heard a great noise anduproar and when he asked what was the matter the people said Two menare going to be hanged', 'As he came nearer he saw that the two men werehis brothers who had turned robbers so he said Cannot they in anyway be saved But the people said No unless he would bestow all hismoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty', 'Then he did not stay tothink about the matter but paid what was asked and his brothers weregiven up and went on with him towards their home.And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them it was socool and pleasant that the two brothers said Let us sit down by theside of the river and rest a while to eat and drink', 'So he saidYes and forgot the foxs counsel and sat down on the side of theriver and while he suspected nothing they came behind and threw himdown the bank and took the princess the horse and the bird and wenthome to the king their master and said', 'All this have we won by ourlabour', 'Then there was great rejoicing made but the horse would noteat the bird would not sing and the princess wept.The youngest son fell to the bottom of the rivers bed luckily it wasnearly dry but his bones were almost broken and the bank was so steepthat he could find no way to get out', 'Then the old fox came once moreand scolded him for not following his advice otherwise no evil wouldhave befallen him Yet said he I cannot leave you here so lay holdof my tail and hold fast', 'Then he pulled him out of the river and saidto him as he got upon the bank Your brothers have set watch to killyou if they find you in the kingdom', 'So he dressed himself as a poorman and came secretly to the kings court and was scarcely within thedoors when the horse began to eat and the bird to sing and the princessleft off weeping', 'Then he went to the king and told him all hisbrothers roguery and they were seized and punished and he had theprincess given to him again and after the kings death he was heir tohis kingdom.A long while after he went to walk one day in the wood and the old foxmet him and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him and cutoff his head and feet', 'And at last he did so and in a moment thefox was changed into a man and turned out to be the brother of theprincess who had been lost a great many many years.HANS IN LUCKSome men are born to good luck all they do or try to do comesrightall that falls to them is so much gainall their geese areswansall their cards are trumpstoss them which way you will theywill always like poor puss alight upon their legs and only move on somuch the faster', 'The world may very likely not always think of them asthey think of themselves but what care they for the world what can itknow about the matterOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans', 'Seven long years he hadworked hard for his master', 'At last he said Master my time is up Imust go home and see my poor mother once more so pray pay me my wagesand let me go', 'And the master said You have been a faithful and goodservant Hans so your pay shall be handsome', 'Then he gave him a lumpof silver as big as his head.Hans took out his pockethandkerchief put the piece of silver into itthrew it over his shoulder and jogged off on his road homewards', 'As hewent lazily on dragging one foot after another a man came in sighttrotting gaily along on a capital horse', 'Ah said Hans aloud what afine thing it is to ride on horseback There he sits as easy and happyas if he was at home in the chair by his fireside he trips against nostones saves shoeleather and gets on he hardly knows how', 'Hans didnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all and said Wellfriend why do you go on foot then Ah said he I have this load tocarry to be sure it is silver but it is so heavy that I cant hold upmy head and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly', 'What do you sayof making an exchange said the horseman', 'I will give you my horseand you shall give me the silver which will save you a great deal oftrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you', 'With all myheart said Hans but as you are so kind to me I must tell you onethingyou will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.However the horseman got off took the silver helped Hans up gave himthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other and said Whenyou want to go very fast smack your lips loudly together and cryJipHans was delighted as he sat on the horse drew himself up squared hiselbows turned out his toes cracked his whip and rode merrily off oneminute whistling a merry tune and another singing No care and no sorrow  A fig for the morrow  Well laugh and be merry  Sing neigh down derryAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster so hesmacked his lips and cried Jip Away went the horse full gallop andbefore Hans knew what he was about he was thrown off and lay on hisback by the roadside', 'His horse would have ran off if a shepherd whowas coming by driving a cow had not stopped it', 'Hans soon came tohimself and got upon his legs again sadly vexed and said to theshepherd This riding is no joke when a man has the luck to get upona beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would breakhis neck', 'However Im off now once for all I like your cow now a greatdeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick and hasspoiled my best coat you see in this puddle which by the by smellsnot very like a nosegay', 'One can walk along at ones leisure behind thatcowkeep good company and have milk butter and cheese every dayinto the bargain', 'What would I give to have such a prize Well saidthe shepherd if you are so fond of her I will change my cow for yourhorse I like to do good to my neighbours even though I lose by itmyself', 'Done said Hans merrily', 'What a noble heart that good manhas thought he', 'Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse wished Hansand the cow good morning and away he rode.Hans brushed his coat wiped his face and hands rested a while andthen drove off his cow quietly and thought his bargain a very luckyone', 'If I have only a piece of bread and I certainly shall always beable to get that I can whenever I like eat my butter and cheese withit and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk and whatcan I wish for more When he came to an inn he halted ate up all hisbread and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer', 'When he hadrested himself he set off again driving his cow towards his mothersvillage', 'But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on till atlast as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more thanan hour to cross he began to be so hot and parched that his tongueclave to the roof of his mouth', 'I can find a cure for this thoughthe now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst so he tied her to thestump of a tree and held his leathern cap to milk into but not a dropwas to be had', 'Who would have thought that this cow which was to bringhim milk and butter and cheese was all that time utterly dry Hans hadnot thought of looking to that.While he was trying his luck in milking and managing the matter veryclumsily the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome and atlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down and there helay a long while senseless', 'Luckily a butcher soon came by driving apig in a wheelbarrow', 'What is the matter with you my man said thebutcher as he helped him up', 'Hans told him what had happened how hewas dry and wanted to milk his cow but found the cow was dry too', 'Thenthe butcher gave him a flask of ale saying There drink and refreshyourself your cow will give you no milk dont you see she is an oldbeast good for nothing but the slaughterhouse Alas alas saidHans who would have thought it What a shame to take my horse andgive me only a dry cow If I kill her what will she be good for I hatecowbeef it is not tender enough for me', 'If it were a pig nowlikethat fat gentleman you are driving along at his easeone could dosomething with it it would at any rate make sausages', 'Well saidthe butcher I dont like to say no when one is asked to do a kindneighbourly thing', 'To please you I will change and give you my fine fatpig for the cow', 'Heaven reward you for your kindness and selfdenialsaid Hans as he gave the butcher the cow and taking the pig off thewheelbarrow drove it away holding it by the string that was tied toits leg.So on he jogged and all seemed now to go right with him he had metwith some misfortunes to be sure but he was now well repaid for all.How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had atlast gotThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose', 'Thecountryman stopped to ask what was oclock this led to further chatand Hans told him all his luck how he had so many good bargains andhow all the world went gay and smiling with him', 'The countryman thenbegan to tell his tale and said he was going to take the goose to achristening', 'Feel said he how heavy it is and yet it is only eightweeks old', 'Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon itit has lived so well Youre right said Hans as he weighed it inhis hand but if you talk of fat my pig is no trifle', 'Meantime thecountryman began to look grave and shook his head', 'Hark ye said hemy worthy friend you seem a good sort of fellow so I cant help doingyou a kind turn', 'Your pig may get you into a scrape', 'In the village Ijust came from the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty', 'I wasdreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squires pig', 'Ifyou have and they catch you it will be a bad job for you', 'The leastthey will do will be to throw you into the horsepond', 'Can you swimPoor Hans was sadly frightened', 'Good man cried he pray get me outof this scrape', 'I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or bornbut he may have been the squires for aught I can tell you know thiscountry better than I do take my pig and give me the goose', 'I oughtto have something into the bargain said the countryman give a fatgoose for a pig indeed Tis not everyone would do so much for you asthat', 'However I will not be hard upon you as you are in trouble', 'Thenhe took the string in his hand and drove off the pig by a side pathwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care', 'After allthought he that chap is pretty well taken in', 'I dont care whose pigit is but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me', 'Ihave much the best of the bargain', 'First there will be a capital roastthen the fat will find me in goosegrease for six months and then thereare all the beautiful white feathers', 'I will put them into my pillowand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking', 'How happy mymother will be Talk of a pig indeed Give me a fine fat goose.As he came to the next village he saw a scissorgrinder with his wheelworking and singing Oer hill and oer dale  So happy I roam  Work light and live well  All the world is my home  Then who so blythe so merry as IHans stood looking on for a while and at last said You must be welloff master grinder you seem so happy at your work', 'Yes said theother mine is a golden trade a good grinder never puts his handinto his pocket without finding money in itbut where did you get thatbeautiful goose I did not buy it I gave a pig for it', 'And wheredid you get the pig I gave a cow for it', 'And the cow I gave ahorse for it', 'And the horse I gave a lump of silver as big as myhead for it', 'And the silver Oh I worked hard for that seven longyears', 'You have thriven well in the world hitherto said the grindernow if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your handin it your fortune would be made', 'Very true but how is that to bemanaged How Why you must turn grinder like myself said the otheryou only want a grindstone the rest will come of itself', 'Here is onethat is but little the worse for wear I would not ask more than thevalue of your goose for itwill you buy How can you ask saidHans I should be the happiest man in the world if I could have moneywhenever I put my hand in my pocket what could I want more theresthe goose', 'Now said the grinder as he gave him a common rough stonethat lay by his side this is a most capital stone do but work it wellenough and you can make an old nail cut with it.Hans took the stone and went his way with a light heart his eyessparkled for joy and he said to himself Surely I must have been bornin a lucky hour everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.People are so kind they seem really to think I do them a favour inletting them make me rich and giving me good bargains.Meantime he began to be tired and hungry too for he had given away hislast penny in his joy at getting the cow.At last he could go no farther for the stone tired him sadly and hedragged himself to the side of a river that he might take a drink ofwater and rest a while', 'So he laid the stone carefully by his side onthe bank but as he stooped down to drink he forgot it pushed it alittle and down it rolled plump into the stream.For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water then sprangup and danced for joy and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heavenwith tears in his eyes for its kindness in taking away his only plaguethe ugly heavy stone.How happy am I cried he nobody was ever so lucky as I', 'Then up hegot with a light heart free from all his troubles and walked on tillhe reached his mothers house and told her how very easy the road togood luck was.JORINDA AND JORINDELThere was once an old castle that stood in the middle of a deep gloomywood and in the castle lived an old fairy', 'Now this fairy could takeany shape she pleased', 'All the day long she flew about in the form ofan owl or crept about the country like a cat but at night she alwaysbecame an old woman again', 'When any young man came within a hundredpaces of her castle he became quite fixed and could not move a steptill she came and set him free which she would not do till he had givenher his word never to come there again but when any pretty maiden camewithin that space she was changed into a bird and the fairy put herinto a cage and hung her up in a chamber in the castle', 'There wereseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle and all withbeautiful birds in them.Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda', 'She was prettierthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before and a shepherdlad whose name was Jorindel was very fond of her and they were soonto be married', 'One day they went to walk in the wood that they might bealone and Jorindel said We must take care that we dont go too nearto the fairys castle', 'It was a beautiful evening the last rays of thesetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees uponthe green underwood beneath and the turtledoves sang from the tallbirches.Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun Jorindel sat by her side andboth felt sad they knew not why but it seemed as if they were to beparted from one another for ever', 'They had wandered a long way and whenthey looked to see which way they should go home they found themselvesat a loss to know what path to take.The sun was setting fast and already half of its circle had sunk behindthe hill Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him and saw through thebushes that they had without knowing it sat down close under the oldwalls of the castle', 'Then he shrank for fear turned pale and trembled.Jorinda was just singing The ringdove sang from the willow spray  Welladay Welladay  He mournd for the fate of his darling mate  Welladaywhen her song stopped suddenly', 'Jorindel turned to see the reason andbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale so that her song endedwith a mournful jug jug', 'An owl with fiery eyes flew three timesround them and three times screamed Tu whu Tu whu Tu whuJorindel could not move he stood fixed as a stone and could neitherweep nor speak nor stir hand or foot', 'And now the sun went quite downthe gloomy night came the owl flew into a bush and a moment after theold fairy came forth pale and meagre with staring eyes and a nose andchin that almost met one another.She mumbled something to herself seized the nightingale and went awaywith it in her hand', 'Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gonebutwhat could he do He could not speak he could not move from the spotwhere he stood', 'At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarsevoice Till the prisoner is fast  And her doom is cast  There stay Oh stay  When the charm is around her  And the spell has bound her  Hie away awayOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free', 'Then he fell on his kneesbefore the fairy and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda butshe laughed at him and said he should never see her again then shewent her way.He prayed he wept he sorrowed but all in vain', 'Alas he said whatwill become of me He could not go back to his own home so he went toa strange village and employed himself in keeping sheep', 'Many a timedid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared gobut all in vain he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flowerand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl and he dreamt that heplucked the flower and went with it in his hand into the castle andthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted and that there hefound his Jorinda again.In the morning when he awoke he began to search over hill and dale forthis pretty flower and eight long days he sought for it in vain buton the ninth day early in the morning he found the beautiful purpleflower and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop as big as a costlypearl', 'Then he plucked the flower and set out and travelled day andnight till he came again to the castle.He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it and yet he did not becomefixed as before but found that he could go quite close up to the door.Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this', 'Then he touched the door withthe flower and it sprang open so that he went in through the courtand listened when he heard so many birds singing', 'At last he came to thechamber where the fairy sat with the seven hundred birds singing inthe seven hundred cages', 'When she saw Jorindel she was very angry andscreamed with rage but she could not come within two yards of him forthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard', 'He looked around atthe birds but alas there were many many nightingales and how thenshould he find out which was his Jorinda While he was thinking what todo he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages and was making thebest of her way off through the door', 'He ran or flew after her touchedthe cage with the flower and Jorinda stood before him and threw herarms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever as beautiful as whenthey walked together in the wood.Then he touched all the other birds with the flower so that they alltook their old forms again and he took Jorinda home where they weremarried and lived happily together many years and so did a good manyother lads whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairyscages by themselves much longer than they liked.THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANSAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to hima great many years but was now growing old and every day more and moreunfit for work', 'His master therefore was tired of keeping him andbegan to think of putting an end to him but the ass who saw that somemischief was in the wind took himself slyly off and began his journeytowards the great city For there thought he I may turn musician.After he had travelled a little way he spied a dog lying by theroadside and panting as if he were tired', 'What makes you pant so myfriend said the ass', 'Alas said the dog my master was going toknock me on the head because I am old and weak and can no longer makemyself useful to him in hunting so I ran away but what can I do toearn my livelihood Hark ye said the ass I am going to the greatcity to turn musician suppose you go with me and try what you cando in the same way The dog said he was willing and they jogged ontogether.They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of theroad and making a most rueful face', 'Pray my good lady said the asswhats the matter with you You look quite out of spirits Ah mesaid the cat how can one be in good spirits when ones life is indanger Because I am beginning to grow old and had rather lie at myease by the fire than run about the house after the mice my mistresslaid hold of me and was going to drown me and though I have been luckyenough to get away from her I do not know what I am to live upon.Oh said the ass by all means go with us to the great city you area good night singer and may make your fortune as a musician', 'The catwas pleased with the thought and joined the party.Soon afterwards as they were passing by a farmyard they saw a cockperched upon a gate and screaming out with all his might and main.Bravo said the ass upon my word you make a famous noise pray whatis all this about Why said the cock I was just now saying thatwe should have fine weather for our washingday and yet my mistress andthe cook dont thank me for my pains but threaten to cut off myhead tomorrow and make broth of me for the guests that are comingon Sunday Heaven forbid said the ass come with us MasterChanticleer it will be better at any rate than staying here to haveyour head cut off Besides who knows If we care to sing in tune wemay get up some kind of a concert so come along with us', 'With all myheart said the cock so they all four went on jollily together.They could not however reach the great city the first day so whennight came on they went into a wood to sleep', 'The ass and the dog laidthemselves down under a great tree and the cat climbed up into thebranches while the cock thinking that the higher he sat the safer heshould be flew up to the very top of the tree and then according tohis custom before he went to sleep looked out on all sides of him tosee that everything was well', 'In doing this he saw afar off somethingbright and shining and calling to his companions said There must be ahouse no great way off for I see a light', 'If that be the case saidthe ass we had better change our quarters for our lodging is not thebest in the world Besides added the dog I should not be theworse for a bone or two or a bit of meat', 'So they walked off togethertowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light and as they drewnear it became larger and brighter till they at last came close to ahouse in which a gang of robbers lived.The ass being the tallest of the company marched up to the window andpeeped in', 'Well Donkey said Chanticleer what do you see Whatdo I see replied the ass', 'Why I see a table spread with all kinds ofgood things and robbers sitting round it making merry', 'That wouldbe a noble lodging for us said the cock', 'Yes said the ass if wecould only get in so they consulted together how they should contriveto get the robbers out and at last they hit upon a plan', 'The ass placedhimself upright on his hind legs with his forefeet resting against thewindow the dog got upon his back the cat scrambled up to the dogsshoulders and the cock flew up and sat upon the cats head', 'Whenall was ready a signal was given and they began their music', 'The assbrayed the dog barked the cat mewed and the cock screamed and thenthey all broke through the window at once and came tumbling intothe room amongst the broken glass with a most hideous clatter Therobbers who had been not a little frightened by the opening concerthad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon themand scampered away as fast as they could.The coast once clear our travellers soon sat down and dispatched whatthe robbers had left with as much eagerness as if they had not expectedto eat again for a month', 'As soon as they had satisfied themselves theyput out the lights and each once more sought out a restingplace tohis own liking', 'The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw inthe yard the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door thecat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes and thecock perched upon a beam on the top of the house and as they were allrather tired with their journey they soon fell asleep.But about midnight when the robbers saw from afar that the lights wereout and that all seemed quiet they began to think that they had been intoo great a hurry to run away and one of them who was bolder thanthe rest went to see what was going on', 'Finding everything still hemarched into the kitchen and groped about till he found a match inorder to light a candle and then espying the glittering fiery eyes ofthe cat he mistook them for live coals and held the match to them tolight it', 'But the cat not understanding this joke sprang at his faceand spat and scratched at him', 'This frightened him dreadfully and awayhe ran to the back door but there the dog jumped up and bit him in theleg and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him and thecock who had been awakened by the noise crowed with all his might', 'Atthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades and toldthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house and had spat athim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers how a man with aknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door and stabbed himin the leg how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with aclub and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried outThrow the rascal up here After this the robbers never dared to goback to the house but the musicians were so pleased with their quartersthat they took up their abode there and there they are I dare say atthis very day.OLD SULTANA shepherd had a faithful dog called Sultan who was grown very oldand had lost all his teeth', 'And one day when the shepherd and his wifewere standing together before the house the shepherd said I will shootold Sultan tomorrow morning for he is of no use now', 'But his wifesaid Pray let the poor faithful creature live he has served us well agreat many years and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest ofhis days', 'But what can we do with him said the shepherd he has nota tooth in his head and the thieves dont care for him at all tobe sure he has served us but then he did it to earn his livelihoodtomorrow shall be his last day depend upon it.Poor Sultan who was lying close by them heard all that the shepherdand his wife said to one another and was very much frightened to thinktomorrow would be his last day so in the evening he went to his goodfriend the wolf who lived in the wood and told him all his sorrowsand how his master meant to kill him in the morning', 'Make yourselfeasy said the wolf I will give you some good advice', 'Your masteryou know goes out every morning very early with his wife into thefield and they take their little child with them and lay it downbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work', 'Now do you liedown close by the child and pretend to be watching it and I will comeout of the wood and run away with it you must run after me as fast asyou can and I will let it drop then you may carry it back and theywill think you have saved their child and will be so thankful to youthat they will take care of you as long as you live', 'The dog liked thisplan very well and accordingly so it was managed', 'The wolf ran with thechild a little way the shepherd and his wife screamed out but Sultansoon overtook him and carried the poor little thing back to his masterand mistress', 'Then the shepherd patted him on the head and said OldSultan has saved our child from the wolf and therefore he shall liveand be well taken care of and have plenty to eat', 'Wife go home andgive him a good dinner and let him have my old cushion to sleep onas long as he lives', 'So from this time forward Sultan had all that hecould wish for.Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy and said Now mygood fellow you must tell no tales but turn your head the other waywhen I want to taste one of the old shepherds fine fat sheep', 'Nosaid the Sultan I will be true to my master', 'However the wolfthought he was in joke and came one night to get a dainty morsel', 'ButSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do so he laid waitfor him behind the barn door and when the wolf was busy looking out fora good fat sheep he had a stout cudgel laid about his back that combedhis locks for him finely.Then the wolf was very angry and called Sultan an old rogue andswore he would have his revenge', 'So the next morning the wolf sent theboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter', 'NowSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherds oldthreelegged cat so he took her with him and as the poor thing limpedalong with some trouble she stuck up her tail straight in the air.The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground and when theyespied their enemies coming and saw the cats long tail standingstraight in the air they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan tofight with and every time she limped they thought she was picking upa stone to throw at them so they said they should not like this way offighting and the boar lay down behind a bush and the wolf jumpedup into a tree', 'Sultan and the cat soon came up and looked about andwondered that no one was there', 'The boar however had not quite hiddenhimself for his ears stuck out of the bush and when he shook one ofthem a little the cat seeing something move and thinking it was amouse sprang upon it and bit and scratched it so that the boar jumpedup and grunted and ran away roaring out Look up in the tree theresits the one who is to blame', 'So they looked up and espied the wolfsitting amongst the branches and they called him a cowardly rascaland would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed ofhimself and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEANIn a village dwelt a poor old woman who had gathered together a dishof beans and wanted to cook them', 'So she made a fire on her hearth andthat it might burn the quicker she lighted it with a handful of straw.When she was emptying the beans into the pan one dropped without herobserving it and lay on the ground beside a straw and soon afterwardsa burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two', 'Then the strawbegan and said Dear friends from whence do you come here The coalreplied I fortunately sprang out of the fire and if I had not escapedby sheer force my death would have been certainI should have beenburnt to ashes', 'The bean said I too have escaped with a whole skinbut if the old woman had got me into the pan I should have been madeinto broth without any mercy like my comrades', 'And would a betterfate have fallen to my lot said the straw', 'The old woman hasdestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke she seized sixty of them atonce and took their lives', 'I luckily slipped through her fingers.But what are we to do now said the coal.I think answered the bean that as we have so fortunately escapeddeath we should keep together like good companions and lest a newmischance should overtake us here we should go away together andrepair to a foreign country.The proposition pleased the two others and they set out on their waytogether', 'Soon however they came to a little brook and as there wasno bridge or footplank they did not know how they were to get overit', 'The straw hit on a good idea and said I will lay myself straightacross and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge', 'The strawtherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other and the coalwho was of an impetuous disposition tripped quite boldly on to thenewlybuilt bridge', 'But when she had reached the middle and heard thewater rushing beneath her she was after all afraid and stood stilland ventured no farther', 'The straw however began to burn broke intwo pieces and fell into the stream', 'The coal slipped after her hissedwhen she got into the water and breathed her last', 'The bean who hadprudently stayed behind on the shore could not but laugh at the eventwas unable to stop and laughed so heartily that she burst', 'It wouldhave been all over with her likewise if by good fortune a tailor whowas travelling in search of work had not sat down to rest by the brook.As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and threadand sewed her together', 'The bean thanked him most prettily but as thetailor used black thread all beans since then have a black seam.BRIAR ROSEA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way offwhere there were in those days fairies', 'Now this king and queen hadplenty of money and plenty of fine clothes to wear and plenty ofgood things to eat and drink and a coach to ride out in every day butthough they had been married many years they had no children and thisgrieved them very much indeed', 'But one day as the queen was walkingby the side of the river at the bottom of the garden she saw a poorlittle fish that had thrown itself out of the water and lay gaspingand nearly dead on the bank', 'Then the queen took pity on the littlefish and threw it back again into the river and before it swam awayit lifted its head out of the water and said I know what your wish isand it shall be fulfilled in return for your kindness to meyou willsoon have a daughter', 'What the little fish had foretold soon came topass and the queen had a little girl so very beautiful that the kingcould not cease looking on it for joy and said he would hold a greatfeast and make merry and show the child to all the land', 'So he askedhis kinsmen and nobles and friends and neighbours', 'But the queensaid I will have the fairies also that they might be kind and goodto our little daughter', 'Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdombut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eatout of they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.So twelve fairies came each with a high red cap on her head and redshoes with high heels on her feet and a long white wand in her handand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave alltheir best gifts to the little princess', 'One gave her goodness anotherbeauty another riches and so on till she had all that was good in theworld.Just as eleven of them had done blessing her a great noise was heard inthe courtyard and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy wascome with a black cap on her head and black shoes on her feet and abroomstick in her hand and presently up she came into the dininghall.Now as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry andscolded the king and queen very much and set to work to take herrevenge', 'So she cried out The kings daughter shall in her fifteenthyear be wounded by a spindle and fall down dead', 'Then the twelfth ofthe friendly fairies who had not yet given her gift came forward andsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled but that she could soften itsmischief so her gift was that the kings daughter when the spindlewounded her should not really die but should only fall asleep for ahundred years.However the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether fromthe threatened evil so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdomshould be bought up and burnt', 'But all the gifts of the first elevenfairies were in the meantime fulfilled for the princess was sobeautiful and well behaved and good and wise that everyone who knewher loved her.It happened that on the very day she was fifteen years old the kingand queen were not at home and she was left alone in the palace', 'So sheroved about by herself and looked at all the rooms and chambers tillat last she came to an old tower to which there was a narrow staircaseending with a little door', 'In the door there was a golden key and whenshe turned it the door sprang open and there sat an old lady spinningaway very busily', 'Why how now good mother said the princess whatare you doing there Spinning said the old lady and nodded herhead humming a tune while buzz went the wheel', 'How prettily thatlittle thing turns round said the princess and took the spindleand began to try and spin', 'But scarcely had she touched it before thefairys prophecy was fulfilled the spindle wounded her and she felldown lifeless on the ground.However she was not dead but had only fallen into a deep sleep andthe king and the queen who had just come home and all their courtfell asleep too and the horses slept in the stables and the dogs inthe court the pigeons on the housetop and the very flies slept uponthe walls', 'Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing and went tosleep the jack stopped and the spit that was turning about with agoose upon it for the kings dinner stood still and the cook who wasat that moment pulling the kitchenboy by the hair to give him a boxon the ear for something he had done amiss let him go and both fellasleep the butler who was slyly tasting the ale fell asleep with thejug at his lips and thus everything stood still and slept soundly.A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace and every year itbecame higher and thicker till at last the old palace was surroundedand hidden so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen', 'Butthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping BriarRose for so the kings daughter was called so that from time totime several kings sons came and tried to break through the thicketinto the palace', 'This however none of them could ever do for thethorns and bushes laid hold of them as it were with hands and therethey stuck fast and died wretchedly.After many many years there came a kings son into that land and anold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns and how a beautifulpalace stood behind it and how a wonderful princess called Briar Roselay in it asleep with all her court', 'He told too how he had heardfrom his grandfather that many many princes had come and had tried tobreak through the thicket but that they had all stuck fast in it anddied', 'Then the young prince said All this shall not frighten me Iwill go and see this Briar Rose', 'The old man tried to hinder him buthe was bent upon going.Now that very day the hundred years were ended and as the prince cameto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs throughwhich he went with ease and they shut in after him as thick as ever.Then he came at last to the palace and there in the court lay the dogsasleep and the horses were standing in the stables and on the roof satthe pigeons fast asleep with their heads under their wings', 'And when hecame into the palace the flies were sleeping on the walls the spitwas standing still the butler had the jug of ale at his lips goingto drink a draught the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to beplucked and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand asif she was going to beat the boy.Then he went on still farther and all was so still that he could hearevery breath he drew till at last he came to the old tower and openedthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was and there she layfast asleep on a couch by the window', 'She looked so beautiful that hecould not take his eyes off her so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke and smiledupon him and they went out together and soon the king and queen alsoawoke and all the court and gazed on each other with great wonder.And the horses shook themselves and the dogs jumped up and barked thepigeons took their heads from under their wings and looked about andflew into the fields the flies on the walls buzzed again the fire inthe kitchen blazed up round went the jack and round went the spitwith the goose for the kings dinner upon it the butler finished hisdraught of ale the maid went on plucking the fowl and the cook gavethe boy the box on his ear.And then the prince and Briar Rose were married and the wedding feastwas given and they lived happily together all their lives long.THE DOG AND THE SPARROWA shepherds dog had a master who took no care of him but often let himsuffer the greatest hunger', 'At last he could bear it no longer so hetook to his heels and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.On the road he met a sparrow that said to him Why are you so sadmy friend Because said the dog I am very very hungry and havenothing to eat', 'If that be all answered the sparrow come with meinto the next town and I will soon find you plenty of food', 'So on theywent together into the town and as they passed by a butchers shopthe sparrow said to the dog Stand there a little while till I peck youdown a piece of meat', 'So the sparrow perched upon the shelf and havingfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her shepecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelftill at last down it fell', 'Then the dog snapped it up and scrambledaway with it into a corner where he soon ate it all up', 'Well saidthe sparrow you shall have some more if you will so come with me tothe next shop and I will peck you down another steak', 'When the dog hadeaten this too the sparrow said to him Well my good friend have youhad enough now I have had plenty of meat answered he but I shouldlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it', 'Come with me thensaid the sparrow and you shall soon have that too', 'So she took himto a bakers shop and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window tillthey fell down and as the dog still wished for more she took him toanother shop and pecked down some more for him', 'When that was eaten thesparrow asked him whether he had had enough now', 'Yes said he andnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town', 'So they both wentout upon the high road but as the weather was warm they had not gonefar before the dog said I am very much tiredI should like to take anap', 'Very well answered the sparrow do so and in the meantimeI will perch upon that bush', 'So the dog stretched himself out on theroad and fell fast asleep', 'Whilst he slept there came by a carter witha cart drawn by three horses and loaded with two casks of wine', 'Thesparrow seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way but wouldgo on in the track in which the dog lay so as to drive over him calledout Stop stop Mr Carter or it shall be the worse for you', 'But thecarter grumbling to himself You make it the worse for me indeedwhat can you do cracked his whip and drove his cart over the poordog so that the wheels crushed him to death', 'There cried thesparrow thou cruel villain thou hast killed my friend the dog', 'Nowmind what I say', 'This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.Do your worst and welcome said the brute what harm can you do meand passed on', 'But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart andpecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it and thenall the wine ran out without the carter seeing it', 'At last he lookedround and saw that the cart was dripping and the cask quite empty.What an unlucky wretch I am cried he', 'Not wretch enough yet saidthe sparrow as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses andpecked at him till he reared up and kicked', 'When the carter saw thishe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow meaning to killher but she flew away and the blow fell upon the poor horses headwith such force that he fell down dead', 'Unlucky wretch that I amcried he', 'Not wretch enough yet said the sparrow', 'And as the carterwent on with the other two horses she again crept under the tilt of thecart and pecked out the bung of the second cask so that all the wineran out', 'When the carter saw this he again cried out Miserable wretchthat I am But the sparrow answered Not wretch enough yet andperched on the head of the second horse and pecked at him too', 'Thecarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet but away sheflew and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on thespot', 'Unlucky wretch that I am said he', 'Not wretch enough yet saidthe sparrow and perching upon the third horse she began to peck himtoo', 'The carter was mad with fury and without looking about him orcaring what he was about struck again at the sparrow but killed histhird horse as he done the other two', 'Alas miserable wretch that Iam cried he', 'Not wretch enough yet answered the sparrow as she flewaway now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house', 'Thecarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him and to go homeoverflowing with rage and vexation', 'Alas said he to his wife whatill luck has befallen memy wine is all spilt and my horses all threedead', 'Alas husband replied she and a wicked bird has come intothe house and has brought with her all the birds in the world I amsure and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft and are eating itup at such a rate Away ran the husband upstairs and saw thousands ofbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn with the sparrow in themidst of them', 'Unlucky wretch that I am cried the carter for he sawthat the corn was almost all gone', 'Not wretch enough yet said thesparrow thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet and away she flew.The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had went downinto his kitchen and was still not sorry for what he had done but sathimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner', 'But the sparrow saton the outside of the window and cried Carter thy cruelty shall costthee thy life With that he jumped up in a rage seized his hatchetand threw it at the sparrow but it missed her and only broke thewindow', 'The sparrow now hopped in perched upon the windowseat andcried Carter it shall cost thee thy life Then he became mad andblind with rage and struck the windowseat with such force that hecleft it in two and as the sparrow flew from place to place the carterand his wife were so furious that they broke all their furnitureglasses chairs benches the table and at last the walls withouttouching the bird at all', 'In the end however they caught her and thewife said Shall I kill her at once No cried he that is lettingher off too easily she shall die a much more cruel death I will eather', 'But the sparrow began to flutter about and stretch out her neckand cried Carter it shall cost thee thy life yet With that hecould wait no longer so he gave his wife the hatchet and cried Wifestrike at the bird and kill her in my hand', 'And the wife struck butshe missed her aim and hit her husband on the head so that he fell downdead and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSESThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters', 'They slept intwelve beds all in one room and when they went to bed the doors wereshut and locked up but every morning their shoes were found to be quiteworn through as if they had been danced in all night and yet nobodycould find out how it happened or where they had been.Then the king made it known to all the land that if any person coulddiscover the secret and find out where it was that the princessesdanced in the night he should have the one he liked best for hiswife and should be king after his death but whoever tried and did notsucceed after three days and nights should be put to death.A kings son soon came', 'He was well entertained and in the evening wastaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in theirtwelve beds', 'There he was to sit and watch where they went to danceand in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it the doorof his chamber was left open', 'But the kings son soon fell asleep andwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all beendancing for the soles of their shoes were full of holes', 'The same thinghappened the second and third night so the king ordered his head to becut off', 'After him came several others but they had all the same luckand all lost their lives in the same manner.Now it chanced that an old soldier who had been wounded in battleand could fight no longer passed through the country where this kingreigned and as he was travelling through a wood he met an old womanwho asked him where he was going', 'I hardly know where I am going orwhat I had better do said the soldier but I think I should like verywell to find out where it is that the princesses dance and then in timeI might be a king', 'Well said the old dame that is no very hardtask only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of theprincesses will bring to you in the evening and as soon as she leavesyou pretend to be fast asleep.Then she gave him a cloak and said As soon as you put that onyou will become invisible and you will then be able to follow theprincesses wherever they go', 'When the soldier heard all this goodcounsel he determined to try his luck so he went to the king and saidhe was willing to undertake the task.He was as well received as the others had been and the king orderedfine royal robes to be given him and when the evening came he was ledto the outer chamber', 'Just as he was going to lie down the eldest ofthe princesses brought him a cup of wine but the soldier threw it allaway secretly taking care not to drink a drop', 'Then he laid himselfdown on his bed and in a little while began to snore very loud as ifhe was fast asleep', 'When the twelve princesses heard this they laughedheartily and the eldest said This fellow too might have done a wiserthing than lose his life in this way Then they rose up and openedtheir drawers and boxes and took out all their fine clothes anddressed themselves at the glass and skipped about as if they were eagerto begin dancing', 'But the youngest said I dont know how it is whileyou are so happy I feel very uneasy I am sure some mischance willbefall us', 'You simpleton said the eldest you are always afraidhave you forgotten how many kings sons have already watched in vainAnd as for this soldier even if I had not given him his sleepingdraught he would have slept soundly enough.When they were all ready they went and looked at the soldier but hesnored on and did not stir hand or foot so they thought they werequite safe and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her handsand the bed sank into the floor and a trapdoor flew open', 'The soldiersaw them going down through the trapdoor one after another the eldestleading the way and thinking he had no time to lose he jumped up puton the cloak which the old woman had given him and followed thembut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngestprincess and she cried out to her sisters All is not right someonetook hold of my gown', 'You silly creature said the eldest it isnothing but a nail in the wall', 'Then down they all went and at thebottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees andthe leaves were all of silver and glittered and sparkled beautifully.The soldier wished to take away some token of the place so he brokeoff a little branch and there came a loud noise from the tree', 'Then theyoungest daughter said again I am sure all is not rightdid not youhear that noise That never happened before', 'But the eldest said Itis only our princes who are shouting for joy at our approach.Then they came to another grove of trees where all the leaves were ofgold and afterwards to a third where the leaves were all glitteringdiamonds', 'And the soldier broke a branch from each and every time therewas a loud noise which made the youngest sister tremble with fear butthe eldest still said it was only the princes who were crying for joy.So they went on till they came to a great lake and at the side of thelake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in themwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.One of the princesses went into each boat and the soldier stepped intothe same boat with the youngest', 'As they were rowing over the lake theprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldiersaid I do not know why it is but though I am rowing with all my mightwe do not get on so fast as usual and I am quite tired the boatseems very heavy today', 'It is only the heat of the weather said theprincess I feel it very warm too.On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle fromwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets', 'There they all landedand went into the castle and each prince danced with his princess andthe soldier who was all the time invisible danced with them too andwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her he drank itall up so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty', 'At thistoo the youngest sister was terribly frightened but the eldest alwayssilenced her', 'They danced on till three oclock in the morning and thenall their shoes were worn out so that they were obliged to leave off.The princes rowed them back again over the lake but this time thesoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess and on theopposite shore they took leave of each other the princesses promisingto come again the next night.When they came to the stairs the soldier ran on before the princessesand laid himself down and as the twelve sisters slowly came up verymuch tired they heard him snoring in his bed so they said Now allis quite safe then they undressed themselves put away their fineclothes pulled off their shoes and went to bed', 'In the morning thesoldier said nothing about what had happened but determined to see moreof this strange adventure and went again the second and third nightand every thing happened just as before the princesses danced each timetill their shoes were worn to pieces and then returned home', 'Howeveron the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as atoken of where he had been.As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret he was takenbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup and thetwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he wouldsay', 'And when the king asked him', 'Where do my twelve daughters dance atnight he answered With twelve princes in a castle under ground', 'Andthen he told the king all that had happened and showed him the threebranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him', 'Then the kingcalled for the princesses and asked them whether what the soldier saidwas true and when they saw that they were discovered and that it wasof no use to deny what had happened they confessed it all', 'And the kingasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife and heanswered I am not very young so I will have the eldest.And theywere married that very day and the soldier was chosen to be the kingsheir.THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFEThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty closeby the seaside', 'The fisherman used to go out all day long afishing andone day as he sat on the shore with his rod looking at the sparklingwaves and watching his line all on a sudden his float was dragged awaydeep into the water and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.But the fish said Pray let me live I am not a real fish I am anenchanted prince put me in the water again and let me go Oh hosaid the man you need not make so many words about the matter I willhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk so swim away sir as soonas you please Then he put him back into the water and the fish dartedstraight down to the bottom and left a long streak of blood behind himon the wave.When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty he told her howhe had caught a great fish and how it had told him it was an enchantedprince and how on hearing it speak he had let it go again', 'Did notyou ask it for anything said the wife we live very wretchedly herein this nasty dirty pigsty do go back and tell the fish we want a snuglittle cottage.The fisherman did not much like the business however he went to theseashore and when he came back there the water looked all yellow andgreen', 'And he stood at the waters edge and said O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeThen the fish came swimming to him and said Well what is her willWhat does your wife want Ah said the fisherman she says that whenI had caught you I ought to have asked you for something before I letyou go she does not like living any longer in the pigsty and wantsa snug little cottage', 'Go home then said the fish she is in thecottage already So the man went home and saw his wife standing at thedoor of a nice trim little cottage', 'Come in come in said she isnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had And there was aparlour and a bedchamber and a kitchen and behind the cottage therewas a little garden planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits andthere was a courtyard behind full of ducks and chickens', 'Ah said thefisherman how happily we shall live now We will try to do so atleast said his wife.Everything went right for a week or two and then Dame Ilsabill saidHusband there is not near room enough for us in this cottage thecourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small I should like tohave a large stone castle to live in go to the fish again and tell himto give us a castle', 'Wife said the fisherman I dont like to go tohim again for perhaps he will be angry we ought to be easy with thispretty cottage to live in', 'Nonsense said the wife he will do itvery willingly I know go along and tryThe fisherman went but his heart was very heavy and when he came tothe sea it looked blue and gloomy though it was very calm and he wentclose to the edge of the waves and said O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWell what does she want now said the fish', 'Ah said the mandolefully my wife wants to live in a stone castle', 'Go home thensaid the fish she is standing at the gate of it already', 'So away wentthe fisherman and found his wife standing before the gate of a greatcastle', 'See said she is not this grand With that they went intothe castle together and found a great many servants there and therooms all richly furnished and full of golden chairs and tables andbehind the castle was a garden and around it was a park half amile long full of sheep and goats and hares and deer and in thecourtyard were stables and cowhouses', 'Well said the man now wewill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest ofour lives', 'Perhaps we may said the wife but let us sleep upon itbefore we make up our minds to that', 'So they went to bed.The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight andshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow and said Get up husbandand bestir yourself for we must be king of all the land', 'Wife wifesaid the man why should we wish to be the king I will not be king.Then I will said she', 'But wife said the fisherman how can yoube kingthe fish cannot make you a king Husband said she sayno more about it but go and try I will be king', 'So the man went awayquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king', 'This timethe sea looked a dark grey colour and was overspread with curling wavesand the ridges of foam as he cried out O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWell what would she have now said the fish', 'Alas said the poorman my wife wants to be king', 'Go home said the fish she is kingalready.Then the fisherman went home and as he came close to the palace he sawa troop of soldiers and heard the sound of drums and trumpets', 'And whenhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamondswith a golden crown upon her head and on each side of her stood sixfair maidens each a head taller than the other', 'Well wife said thefisherman are you king Yes said she I am king', 'And when he hadlooked at her for a long time he said Ah wife what a fine thing itis to be king Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as longas we live', 'I dont know how that may be said she never is a longtime', 'I am king it is true but I begin to be tired of that and Ithink I should like to be emperor', 'Alas wife why should you wish tobe emperor said the fisherman', 'Husband said she go to the fishI say I will be emperor', 'Ah wife replied the fisherman the fishcannot make an emperor I am sure and I should not like to ask him forsuch a thing', 'I am king said Ilsabill and you are my slave so goat onceSo the fisherman was forced to go and he muttered as he went alongThis will come to no good it is too much to ask the fish will betired at last and then we shall be sorry for what we have done', 'Hesoon came to the seashore and the water was quite black and muddy anda mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about but hewent as near as he could to the waters brink and said O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWhat would she have now said the fish', 'Ah said the fishermanshe wants to be emperor', 'Go home said the fish she is emperoralready.So he went home again and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabillsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold with a great crown onher head full two yards high and on each side of her stood her guardsand attendants in a row each one smaller than the other from thetallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger', 'Andbefore her stood princes and dukes and earls and the fisherman wentup to her and said Wife are you emperor Yes said she I amemperor', 'Ah said the man as he gazed upon her what a fine thingit is to be emperor Husband said she why should we stop at beingemperor I will be pope next', 'O wife wife said he how can you bepope there is but one pope at a time in Christendom', 'Husband saidshe I will be pope this very day', 'But replied the husband thefish cannot make you pope', 'What nonsense said she if he can makean emperor he can make a pope go and try him.So the fisherman went', 'But when he came to the shore the wind was ragingand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves and the ships werein trouble and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows', 'In themiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky but towardsthe south all was red as if a dreadful storm was rising', 'At this sightthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened and he trembled so that hisknees knocked together but still he went down near to the shore andsaid O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWhat does she want now said the fish', 'Ah said the fisherman mywife wants to be pope', 'Go home said the fish she is pope already.Then the fisherman went home and found Ilsabill sitting on a thronethat was two miles high', 'And she had three great crowns on her head andaround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church', 'And on each sideof her were two rows of burning lights of all sizes the greatest aslarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world and the least nolarger than a small rushlight', 'Wife said the fisherman as he lookedat all this greatness are you pope Yes said she I am pope.Well wife replied he it is a grand thing to be pope and nowyou must be easy for you can be nothing greater', 'I will think aboutthat said the wife', 'Then they went to bed but Dame Ilsabill could notsleep all night for thinking what she should be next', 'At last as shewas dropping asleep morning broke and the sun rose', 'Ha thought sheas she woke up and looked at it through the window after all I cannotprevent the sun rising', 'At this thought she was very angry and wakenedher husband and said Husband go to the fish and tell him I mustbe lord of the sun and moon', 'The fisherman was half asleep but thethought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.Alas wife said he cannot you be easy with being pope Nosaid she I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without myleave', 'Go to the fish at onceThen the man went shivering with fear and as he was going down tothe shore a dreadful storm arose so that the trees and the very rocksshook', 'And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds and thelightnings played and the thunders rolled and you might have seen inthe sea great black waves swelling up like mountains with crowns ofwhite foam upon their heads', 'And the fisherman crept towards the seaand cried out as well as he could O man of the sea  Hearken to me  My wife Ilsabill  Will have her own will  And hath sent me to beg a boon of theeWhat does she want now said the fish', 'Ah said he she wants tobe lord of the sun and moon', 'Go home said the fish to your pigstyagain.And there they live to this very day.THE WILLOWWREN AND THE BEAROnce in summertime the bear and the wolf were walking in the forestand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said Brotherwolf what bird is it that sings so well That is the King of birdssaid the wolf before whom we must bow down', 'In reality the bird wasthe willowwren', 'IF thats the case said the bear I should verymuch like to see his royal palace come take me thither', 'That is notdone quite as you seem to think said the wolf you must wait untilthe Queen comes Soon afterwards the Queen arrived with some food inher beak and the lord King came too and they began to feed their youngones', 'The bear would have liked to go at once but the wolf held himback by the sleeve and said No you must wait until the lord and ladyQueen have gone away again', 'So they took stock of the hole where thenest lay and trotted away', 'The bear however could not rest until hehad seen the royal palace and when a short time had passed went to itagain', 'The King and Queen had just flown out so he peeped in and sawfive or six young ones lying there', 'Is that the royal palace criedthe bear it is a wretched palace and you are not Kings children youare disreputable children When the young wrens heard that they werefrightfully angry and screamed No that we are not Our parents arehonest people Bear you will have to pay for thatThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy and turned back and went into theirholes', 'The young willowwrens however continued to cry and scream andwhen their parents again brought food they said We will not so much astouch one flys leg no not if we were dying of hunger until you havesettled whether we are respectable children or not the bear has beenhere and has insulted us Then the old King said Be easy he shallbe punished and he at once flew with the Queen to the bears cave andcalled in Old Growler why have you insulted my children You shallsuffer for itwe will punish you by a bloody war', 'Thus war wasannounced to the Bear and all fourfooted animals were summoned to takepart in it oxen asses cows deer and every other animal the earthcontained', 'And the willowwren summoned everything which flew in theair not only birds large and small but midges and hornets bees andflies had to come.When the time came for the war to begin the willowwren sent out spiesto discover who was the enemys commanderinchief', 'The gnat who wasthe most crafty flew into the forest where the enemy was assembledand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to beannounced', 'There stood the bear and he called the fox before himand said Fox you are the most cunning of all animals you shall begeneral and lead us', 'Good said the fox but what signal shall weagree upon No one knew that so the fox said I have a fine longbushy tail which almost looks like a plume of red feathers', 'When I liftmy tail up quite high all is going well and you must charge but if Ilet it hang down run away as fast as you can', 'When the gnat had heardthat she flew away again and revealed everything down to the minutestdetail to the willowwren', 'When day broke and the battle was to beginall the fourfooted animals came running up with such a noise that theearth trembled', 'The willowwren with his army also came flying throughthe air with such a humming and whirring and swarming that every onewas uneasy and afraid and on both sides they advanced against eachother', 'But the willowwren sent down the hornet with orders to settlebeneath the foxs tail and sting with all his might', 'When the fox feltthe first string he started so that he lifted one leg from pain buthe bore it and still kept his tail high in the air at the secondsting he was forced to put it down for a moment at the third he couldhold out no longer screamed and put his tail between his legs', 'Whenthe animals saw that they thought all was lost and began to flee eachinto his hole and the birds had won the battle.Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and criedChildren rejoice eat and drink to your hearts content we have wonthe battle But the young wrens said We will not eat yet the bearmust come to the nest and beg for pardon and say that we are honourablechildren before we will do that', 'Then the willowwren flew to thebears hole and cried Growler you are to come to the nest to mychildren and beg their pardon or else every rib of your body shallbe broken', 'So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear and beggedtheir pardon', 'And now at last the young wrens were satisfied and satdown together and ate and drank and made merry till quite late into thenight.THE FROGPRINCEOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs and wentout to take a walk by herself in a wood and when she came to a coolspring of water that rose in the midst of it she sat herself downto rest a while', 'Now she had a golden ball in her hand which was herfavourite plaything and she was always tossing it up into the air andcatching it again as it fell', 'After a time she threw it up so high thatshe missed catching it as it fell and the ball bounded away and rolledalong upon the ground till at last it fell down into the spring', 'Theprincess looked into the spring after her ball but it was very deep sodeep that she could not see the bottom of it', 'Then she began to bewailher loss and said Alas if I could only get my ball again I wouldgive all my fine clothes and jewels and everything that I have in theworld.Whilst she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water and saidPrincess why do you weep so bitterly Alas said she what can youdo for me you nasty frog My golden ball has fallen into the spring.The frog said I want not your pearls and jewels and fine clothesbut if you will love me and let me live with you and eat from offyour golden plate and sleep upon your bed I will bring you your ballagain', 'What nonsense thought the princess this silly frog istalking He can never even get out of the spring to visit me thoughhe may be able to get my ball for me and therefore I will tell him heshall have what he asks', 'So she said to the frog Well if you willbring me my ball I will do all you ask', 'Then the frog put his headdown and dived deep under the water and after a little while he cameup again with the ball in his mouth and threw it on the edge of thespring', 'As soon as the young princess saw her ball she ran to pickit up and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again that shenever thought of the frog but ran home with it as fast as she could.The frog called after her Stay princess and take me with you as yousaid But she did not stop to hear a word.The next day just as the princess had sat down to dinner she heard astrange noisetap tapplash plashas if something was coming up themarble staircase and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at thedoor and a little voice cried out and said Open the door my princess dear  Open the door to thy true love here  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.Then the princess ran to the door and opened it and there she sawthe frog whom she had quite forgotten', 'At this sight she was sadlyfrightened and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to herseat', 'The king her father seeing that something had frightened herasked her what was the matter', 'There is a nasty frog said she atthe door that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning Itold him that he should live with me here thinking that he could neverget out of the spring but there he is at the door and he wants to comein.While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door and said Open the door my princess dear  Open the door to thy true love here  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.Then the king said to the young princess As you have given your wordyou must keep it so go and let him in', 'She did so and the frog hoppedinto the room and then straight ontap tapplash plashfrom thebottom of the room to the top till he came up close to the table wherethe princess sat', 'Pray lift me upon chair said he to the princessand let me sit next to you', 'As soon as she had done this the frogsaid Put your plate nearer to me that I may eat out of it', 'Thisshe did and when he had eaten as much as he could he said Now I amtired carry me upstairs and put me into your bed', 'And the princessthough very unwilling took him up in her hand and put him upon thepillow of her own bed where he slept all night long', 'As soon as it waslight he jumped up hopped downstairs and went out of the house.Now then thought the princess at last he is gone and I shall betroubled with him no more.But she was mistaken for when night came again she heard the sametapping at the door and the frog came once more and said Open the door my princess dear  Open the door to thy true love here  And mind the words that thou and I said  By the fountain cool in the greenwood shade.And when the princess opened the door the frog came in and slept uponher pillow as before till the morning broke', 'And the third night he didthe same', 'But when the princess awoke on the following morning she wasastonished to see instead of the frog a handsome prince gazing on herwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen and standing at the headof her bed.He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy who hadchanged him into a frog and that he had been fated so to abide tillsome princess should take him out of the spring and let him eat fromher plate and sleep upon her bed for three nights', 'You said theprince have broken his cruel charm and now I have nothing to wish forbut that you should go with me into my fathers kingdom where I willmarry you and love you as long as you live.The young princess you may be sure was not long in saying Yes toall this and as they spoke a gay coach drove up with eight beautifulhorses decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness and behindthe coach rode the princes servant faithful Heinrich who had bewailedthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and sobitterly that his heart had wellnigh burst.They then took leave of the king and got into the coach with eighthorses and all set out full of joy and merriment for the princeskingdom which they reached safely and there they lived happily a greatmany years.CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIPA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse and had said so muchto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her that atlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.But we must make a provision for winter or else we shall sufferfrom hunger said the cat and you little mouse cannot ventureeverywhere or you will be caught in a trap some day', 'The good advicewas followed and a pot of fat was bought but they did not know whereto put it', 'At length after much consideration the cat said I know noplace where it will be better stored up than in the church for no onedares take anything away from there', 'We will set it beneath the altarand not touch it until we are really in need of it', 'So the pot wasplaced in safety but it was not long before the cat had a greatyearning for it and said to the mouse I want to tell you somethinglittle mouse my cousin has brought a little son into the world and hasasked me to be godmother he is white with brown spots and I am to holdhim over the font at the christening', 'Let me go

myself', 'All thishowever was untrue the cat had no cousin and had not been asked tobe godmother', 'She went straight to the church stole to the pot of fatbegan to lick at it and licked the top of the fat off', 'Then she took awalk upon the roofs of the town looked out for opportunities and thenstretched herself in the sun and licked her lips whenever she thoughtof the pot of fat and not until it was evening did she return home.Well here you are again said the mouse no doubt you have had amerry day', 'All went off well answered the cat', 'What name did theygive the child Top off said the cat quite coolly', 'Top off criedthe mouse that is a very odd and uncommon name is it a usual one inyour family What does that matter said the cat it is no worsethan Crumbstealer as your godchildren are

as the child has awhite ring round its neck I cannot refuse', 'The good mouse consentedbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church and devouredhalf the pot of fat', 'Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps tooneself said she and was quite satisfied with her days work', 'Whenshe went home the mouse inquired And what was the child christenedHalfdone answered the cat', 'Halfdone What are you saying Inever heard the name in my life Ill wager anything it is not in thecalendarThe cats mouth soon began to water for some more licking', 'All goodthings go in threes said she I am asked to stand godmother again.The child is quite black only it has white paws but with thatexception it has not a single white hair on its whole body this onlyhappens once every few years you will let me go wont you TopoffHalfdone answered the mouse they are such odd names they make mevery thoughtful', 'You sit at home said the cat in your darkgreyfur coat and long tail and are filled with fancies thats becauseyou do not go out in the daytime', 'During the cats absence the mousecleaned the house and put it in order but the greedy cat entirelyemptied the pot of fat', 'When everything is eaten up one has somepeace said she to herself and well filled and fat she did not returnhome till night', 'The mouse at once asked what name had been given tothe third child', 'It will not please you more than the others said thecat', 'He is called Allgone', 'Allgone cried the mouse that is themost suspicious name of all I have never seen it in print', 'Allgonewhat can that mean and she shook her head curled herself up and laydown to sleep.From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother butwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be foundoutside the mouse thought of their provision and said Come catwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselvesweshall enjoy that', 'Yes answered the cat you will enjoy it as muchas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of thewindow', 'They set out on their way but when they arrived the pot offat certainly was still in its place but it was empty', 'Alas said themouse now I see what has happened now it comes to light You are a truefriend You have devoured all when you were standing godmother', 'Firsttop off then halfdone then Will you hold your tongue cried thecat one word more and I will eat you too', 'Allgone was already onthe poor mouses lips scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprangon her seized her and swallowed her down', 'Verily that is the way ofthe world.THE GOOSEGIRLThe king of a great land died and left his queen to take care of theironly child', 'This child was a daughter who was very beautiful and hermother loved her dearly and was very kind to her', 'And there was a goodfairy too who was fond of the princess and helped her mother to watchover her', 'When she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived agreat way off and as the time drew near for her to be married shegot ready to set off on her journey to his country', 'Then the queen hermother packed up a great many costly things jewels and gold andsilver trinkets fine dresses and in short everything that became aroyal bride', 'And she gave her a waitingmaid to ride with her and giveher into the bridegrooms hands and each had a horse for the journey.Now the princesss horse was the fairys gift and it was called Faladaand could speak.When the time came for them to set out the fairy went into herbedchamber and took a little knife and cut off a lock of her hairand gave it to the princess and said Take care of it dear child forit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road', 'Then they all tooka sorrowful leave of the princess and she put the lock of hair intoher bosom got upon her horse and set off on her journey to herbridegrooms kingdom.One day as they were riding along by a brook the princess began tofeel very thirsty and she said to her maid Pray get down and fetchme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook for I want todrink', 'Nay said the maid if you are thirsty get off yourself andstoop down by the water and drink I shall not be your waitingmaid anylonger', 'Then she was so thirsty that she got down and knelt over thelittle brook and drank for she was frightened and dared not bring outher golden cup and she wept and said Alas what will become of meAnd the lock answered her and said Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.But the princess was very gentle and meek so she said nothing to hermaids ill behaviour but got upon her horse again.Then all rode farther on their journey till the day grew so warm andthe sun so scorching that the bride began to feel very thirsty againand at last when they came to a river she forgot her maids rudespeech and said Pray get down and fetch me some water to drink inmy golden cup', 'But the maid answered her and even spoke more haughtilythan before Drink if you will but I shall not be your waitingmaid.Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse and laydown and held her head over the running stream and cried and saidWhat will become of me And the lock of hair answered her again Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.And as she leaned down to drink the lock of hair fell from her bosomand floated away with the water', 'Now she was so frightened that she didnot see it but her maid saw it and was very glad for she knew thecharm and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power now thatshe had lost the hair', 'So when the bride had done drinking and wouldhave got upon Falada again the maid said I shall ride upon Faladaand you may have my horse instead so she was forced to give up herhorse and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on hermaids shabby ones.At last as they drew near the end of their journey this treacherousservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what hadhappened', 'But Falada saw it all and marked it well.Then the waitingmaid got upon Falada and the real bride rode upon theother horse and they went on in this way till at last they came to theroyal court', 'There was great joy at their coming and the prince flew tomeet them and lifted the maid from her horse thinking she was the onewho was to be his wife and she was led upstairs to the royal chamberbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do so heamused himself by sitting at his kitchen window looking at what wasgoing on and he saw her in the courtyard', 'As she looked very prettyand too delicate for a waitingmaid he went up into the royal chamberto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her that was thus leftstanding in the court below', 'I brought her with me for the sake of hercompany on the road said she pray give the girl some work to dothat she may not be idle', 'The old king could not for some time thinkof any work for her to do but at last he said I have a lad who takescare of my geese she may go and help him', 'Now the name of this ladthat the real bride was to help in watching the kings geese wasCurdken.But the false bride said to the prince Dear husband pray do me onepiece of kindness', 'That I will said the prince', 'Then tell one ofyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon for itwas very unruly and plagued me sadly on the road but the truth wasshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak andtell all she had done to the princess', 'She carried her point and thefaithful Falada was killed but when the true princess heard of it shewept and begged the man to nail up Faladas head against a largedark gate of the city through which she had to pass every morningand evening that there she might still see him sometimes', 'Then theslaughterer said he would do as she wished and cut off the head andnailed it up under the dark gate.Early the next morning as she and Curdken went out through the gateshe said sorrowfully Falada Falada there thou hangestand the head answered Bride bride there thou gangest  Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.Then they went out of the city and drove the geese on', 'And when shecame to the meadow she sat down upon a bank there and let down herwaving locks of hair which were all of pure silver and when Curdkensaw it glitter in the sun he ran up and would have pulled some of thelocks out but she cried Blow breezes blow  Let Curdkens hat go  Blow breezes blow  Let him after it go  Oer hills dales and rocks  Away be it whirld  Till the silvery locks  Are all combd and curldThen there came a wind so strong that it blew off Curdkens hat andaway it flew over the hills and he was forced to turn and run afterit till by the time he came back she had done combing and curling herhair and had put it up again safe', 'Then he was very angry and sulkyand would not speak to her at all but they watched the geese until itgrew dark in the evening and then drove them homewards.The next morning as they were going through the dark gate the poorgirl looked up at Faladas head and cried Falada Falada there thou hangestand the head answered Bride bride there thou gangest  Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.Then she drove on the geese and sat down again in the meadow and beganto comb out her hair as before and Curdken ran up to her and wanted totake hold of it but she cried out quickly Blow breezes blow  Let Curdkens hat go  Blow breezes blow  Let him after it go  Oer hills dales and rocks  Away be it whirld  Till the silvery locks  Are all combd and curldThen the wind came and blew away his hat and off it flew a great wayover the hills and far away so that he had to run after it and whenhe came back she had bound up her hair again and all was safe', 'So theywatched the geese till it grew dark.In the evening after they came home Curdken went to the old king andsaid I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese anylonger', 'Why said the king', 'Because instead of doing any good shedoes nothing but tease me all day long', 'Then the king made him tell himwhat had happened', 'And Curdken said When we go in the morning throughthe dark gate with our flock of geese she cries and talks with the headof a horse that hangs upon the wall and says Falada Falada there thou hangestand the head answers Bride bride there thou gangest  Alas alas if thy mother knew it  Sadly sadly would she rue it.And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadowwhere the geese fed how his hat was blown away and how he was forcedto run after it and to leave his flock of geese to themselves', 'But theold king told the boy to go out again the next day and when morningcame he placed himself behind the dark gate and heard how she spoketo Falada and how Falada answered', 'Then he went into the field andhid himself in a bush by the meadows side and he soon saw with his owneyes how they drove the flock of geese and how after a little timeshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun', 'And then he heard hersay Blow breezes blow  Let Curdkens hat go  Blow breezes blow  Let him after it go  Oer hills dales and rocks  Away be it whirld  Till the silvery locks  Are all combd and curldAnd soon came a gale of wind and carried away Curdkens hat and awaywent Curdken after it while the girl went on combing and curling herhair', 'All this the old king saw so he went home without being seen andwhen the little goosegirl came back in the evening he called her asideand asked her why she did so but she burst into tears and said ThatI must not tell you or any man or I shall lose my life.But the old king begged so hard that she had no peace till she had toldhim all the tale from beginning to end word for word', 'And it was verylucky for her that she did so for when she had done the king orderedroyal clothes to be put upon her and gazed on her with wonder she wasso beautiful', 'Then he called his son and told him that he had only afalse bride for that she was merely a waitingmaid while the truebride stood by', 'And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty andheard how meek and patient she had been and without saying anything tothe false bride the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for allhis court', 'The bridegroom sat at the top with the false princess on oneside and the true one on the other but nobody knew her again for herbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes and she did not seem at alllike the little goosegirl now that she had her brilliant dress on.When they had eaten and drank and were very merry the old king saidhe would tell them a tale', 'So he began and told all the story of theprincess as if it was one that he had once heard and he asked thetrue waitingmaid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who wouldbehave thus', 'Nothing better said this false bride than that sheshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails and thattwo white horses should be put to it and should drag it from street tostreet till she was dead', 'Thou art she said the old king and asthou has judged thyself so shall it be done to thee', 'And the youngking was then married to his true wife and they reigned over thekingdom in peace and happiness all their lives and the good fairy cameto see them and restored the faithful Falada to life again.THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET', 'HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTSThe nuts are quite ripe now said Chanticleer to his wife Partletsuppose we go together to the mountains and eat as many as we canbefore the squirrel takes them all away', 'With all my heart saidPartlet let us go and make a holiday of it together.So they went to the mountains and as it was a lovely day they stayedthere till the evening', 'Now whether it was that they had eaten so manynuts that they could not walk or whether they were lazy and would notI do not know however they took it into their heads that it did notbecome them to go home on foot', 'So Chanticleer began to build a littlecarriage of nutshells and when it was finished Partlet jumped intoit and sat down and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw herhome', 'Thats a good joke said Chanticleer no that will never doI had rather by half walk home Ill sit on the box and be coachmanif you like but Ill not draw', 'While this was passing a duck camequacking up and cried out You thieving vagabonds what business haveyou in my grounds Ill give it you well for your insolence and uponthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily', 'But Chanticleer was nocoward and returned the ducks blows with his sharp spurs so fiercelythat she soon began to cry out for mercy which was only granted herupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them', 'This sheagreed to do and Chanticleer got upon the box and drove crying Nowduck get on as fast as you can', 'And away they went at a pretty goodpace.After they had travelled along a little way they met a needle and a pinwalking together along the road and the needle cried out Stop stopand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way and suchdirty walking they could not get on at all he told them that he and hisfriend the pin had been at a publichouse a few miles off and had satdrinking till they had forgotten how late it was he begged thereforethat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in theircarriage', 'Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows and notlikely to take up much room told them they might ride but made thempromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in nor totread on Partlets toes.Late at night they arrived at an inn and as it was bad travelling inthe dark and the duck seemed much tired and waddled about a gooddeal from one side to the other they made up their minds to fix theirquarters there but the landlord at first was unwilling and said hishouse was full thinking they might not be very respectable companyhowever they spoke civilly to him and gave him the egg which Partlethad laid by the way and said they would give him the duck who was inthe habit of laying one every day so at last he let them come in andthey bespoke a handsome supper and spent the evening very jollily.Early in the morning before it was quite light and when nobody wasstirring in the inn Chanticleer awakened his wife and fetching theegg they pecked a hole in it ate it up and threw the shells into thefireplace they then went to the pin and needle who were fast asleepand seizing them by the heads stuck one into the landlords easy chairand the other into his handkerchief and having done this they creptaway as softly as possible', 'However the duck who slept in the openair in the yard heard them coming and jumping into the brook which ranclose by the inn soon swam out of their reach.An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up and took his handkerchiefto wipe his face but the pin ran into him and pricked him then hewalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire but when hestirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes and almost blinded him.Bless me said he all the world seems to have a design against myhead this morning and so saying he threw himself sulkily into hiseasy chair but oh dear the needle ran into him and this time thepain was not in his head', 'He now flew into a very great passion andsuspecting the company who had come in the night before he went to lookafter them but they were all off so he swore that he never againwould take in such a troop of vagabonds who ate a great deal paid noreckoning and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.', 'HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBESAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out togetherso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels andharnessed six mice to it and then he and Partlet got into the carriageand away they drove', 'Soon afterwards a cat met them and said Whereare you going And Chanticleer replied All on our way  A visit to pay  To Mr Korbes the

so fine  Now mice be ready  And wheels run steady  For we are going a visit to pay  To Mr Korbes the fox today.Soon after came up a millstone an egg a duck and a pin andChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go withthem.When they arrived at Mr Korbess house he was not at home so the micedrew the carriage into the coachhouse Chanticleer and Partlet flewupon a beam the cat sat down in the fireplace the duck got intothe washing cistern the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow themillstone laid himself over the house door and the egg rolled himselfup in the towel.When Mr Korbes came home he went to the fireplace to make a fire butthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes so he ran to the kitchen towash himself but there the duck splashed all the water in his face andwhen he tried to wipe himself the egg broke to pieces in the towel allover his face and eyes', 'Then he was very angry and went without hissupper to bed but when he laid his head on the pillow the pin ran intohis cheek at this he became quite furious and jumping up would haverun out of the house but when he came to the door the millstone felldown on his head and killed him on the spot.', 'HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEFAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountainsto eat nuts and it was settled that all the nuts which they foundshould be shared equally between them', 'Now Partlet found a very largenut but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer and kept it all toherself however it was so big that she could not swallow it and itstuck in her throat', 'Then she was in a great fright and cried out toChanticleer Pray run as fast as you can and fetch me some water or Ishall be choked', 'Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river andsaid River give me some water for Partlet lies in the mountain andwill be choked by a great nut', 'The river said Run first to the brideand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water', 'Chanticleer ran tothe bride and said Bride you must give me a silken cord for thenthe river will give me water and the water I will carry to Partlet wholies on the mountain and will be choked by a great nut', 'But the bridesaid Run first and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willowin the garden', 'Then Chanticleer ran to the garden and took the garlandfrom the bough where it hung and brought it to the bride and thenthe bride gave him the silken cord and he took the silken cord tothe river and the river gave him water and he carried the water toPartlet but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut and layquite dead and never moved any more.Then Chanticleer was very sorry and cried bitterly and all the beastscame and wept with him over poor Partlet', 'And six mice built a littlehearse to carry her to her grave and when it was ready they harnessedthemselves before it and Chanticleer drove them', 'On the way theymet the fox', 'Where are you going Chanticleer said he', 'To bury myPartlet said the other', 'May I go with you said the fox', 'Yes butyou must get up behind or my horses will not be able to draw you', 'Thenthe fox got up behind and presently the wolf the bear the goat andall the beasts of the wood came and climbed upon the hearse.So on they went till they came to a rapid stream', 'How shall we getover said Chanticleer', 'Then said a straw I will lay myself acrossand you may pass over upon me', 'But as the mice were going over thestraw slipped away and fell into the water and the six mice all fell inand were drowned', 'What was to be done Then a large log of wood cameand said I am big enough I will lay myself across the stream and youshall pass over upon me', 'So he laid himself down but they managedso clumsily that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by thestream', 'Then a stone who saw what had happened came up and kindlyoffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the streamand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse andmanaged to get Partlet out of it but the fox and the other mournerswho were sitting behind were too heavy and fell back into the waterand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet and having duga grave for her he laid her in it and made a little hillock over her.Then he sat down by the grave and wept and mourned till at last hedied too and so all were dead.RAPUNZELThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for achild', 'At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.These people had a little window at the back of their house from whicha splendid garden could be seen which was full of the most beautifulflowers and herbs', 'It was however surrounded by a high wall and noone dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress who hadgreat power and was dreaded by all the world', 'One day the woman wasstanding by this window and looking down into the garden when she saw abed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion rapunzel and itlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it she quite pined awayand began to look pale and miserable', 'Then her husband was alarmed andasked What ails you dear wife Ah she replied if I cant eatsome of the rampion which is in the garden behind our house I shalldie', 'The man who loved her thought Sooner than let your wife diebring her some of the rampion yourself let it cost what it will.At twilight he clambered down over the wall into the garden of theenchantress hastily clutched a handful of rampion and took it to hiswife', 'She at once made herself a salad of it and ate it greedily', 'Ittasted so good to herso very good that the next day she longed for itthree times as much as before', 'If he was to have any rest her husbandmust once more descend into the garden', 'In the gloom of eveningtherefore he let himself down again but when he had clambered down thewall he was terribly afraid for he saw the enchantress standing beforehim', 'How can you dare said she with angry look descend into mygarden and steal my rampion like a thief You shall suffer for itAh answered he let mercy take the place of justice I only madeup my mind to do it out of necessity', 'My wife saw your rampion from thewindow and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if shehad not got some to eat', 'Then the enchantress allowed her anger to besoftened and said to him If the case be as you say I will allowyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will only I make onecondition you must give me the child which your wife will bring intothe world it shall be well treated and I will care for it like amother', 'The man in his terror consented to everything and when thewoman was brought to bed the enchantress appeared at once gave thechild the name of Rapunzel and took it away with her.Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun', 'When she wastwelve years old the enchantress shut her into a tower which lay ina forest and had neither stairs nor door but quite at the top was alittle window', 'When the enchantress wanted to go in she placed herselfbeneath it and cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.Rapunzel had magnificent long hair fine as spun gold and when sheheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresseswound them round one of the hooks of the window above and then the hairfell twenty ells down and the enchantress climbed up by it.After a year or two it came to pass that the kings son rode throughthe forest and passed by the tower', 'Then he heard a song which was socharming that he stood still and listened', 'This was Rapunzel who in hersolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound', 'The kingsson wanted to climb up to her and looked for the door of the towerbut none was to be found', 'He rode home but the singing had so deeplytouched his heart that every day he went out into the forest andlistened to it', 'Once when he was thus standing behind a tree he sawthat an enchantress came there and he heard how she cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair and the enchantressclimbed up to her', 'If that is the ladder by which one mounts I toowill try my fortune said he and the next day when it began to growdark he went to the tower and cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.Immediately the hair fell down and the kings son climbed up.At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyeshad never yet beheld came to her but the kings son began to talk toher quite like a friend and told her that his heart had been so stirredthat it had let him have no rest and he had been forced to see her.Then Rapunzel lost her fear and when he asked her if she would takehim for her husband and she saw that he was young and handsome shethought He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does and she saidyes and laid her hand in his', 'She said I will willingly go away withyou but I do not know how to get down', 'Bring with you a skein of silkevery time that you come and I will weave a ladder with it and whenthat is ready I will descend and you will take me on your horse', 'Theyagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening for theold woman came by day', 'The enchantress remarked nothing of this untilonce Rapunzel said to her Tell me Dame Gothel how it happens thatyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young kings sonheis with me in a moment', 'Ah you wicked child cried the enchantress.What do I hear you say I thought I had separated you from allthe world and yet you have deceived me In her anger she clutchedRapunzels beautiful tresses wrapped them twice round her left handseized a pair of scissors with the right and snip snap they were cutoff and the lovely braids lay on the ground', 'And she was so pitilessthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in greatgrief and misery.On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel however the enchantressfastened the braids of hair which she had cut off to the hook of thewindow and when the kings son came and cried Rapunzel Rapunzel  Let down your hair to me.she let the hair down', 'The kings son ascended but instead of findinghis dearest Rapunzel he found the enchantress who gazed at him withwicked and venomous looks', 'Aha she cried mockingly you would fetchyour dearest but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nestthe cat has got it and will scratch out your eyes as well', 'Rapunzel islost to you you will never see her again', 'The kings son was besidehimself with pain and in his despair he leapt down from the tower', 'Heescaped with his life but the thorns into which he fell pierced hiseyes', 'Then he wandered quite blind about the forest ate nothing butroots and berries and did naught but lament and weep over the loss ofhis dearest wife', 'Thus he roamed about in misery for some years and atlength came to the desert where Rapunzel with the twins to which shehad given birth a boy and a girl lived in wretchedness', 'He heard avoice and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it andwhen he approached Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept', 'Twoof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again and he couldsee with them as before', 'He led her to his kingdom where he wasjoyfully received and they lived for a long time afterwards happy andcontented.FUNDEVOGELThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt and ashe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child werethere', 'He followed the sound and at last came to a high tree and atthe top of this a little child was sitting for the mother had fallenasleep under the tree with the child and a bird of prey had seen it inher arms had flown down snatched it away and set it on the high tree.The forester climbed up brought the child down and thought to himselfYou will take him home with you and bring him up with your Lina', 'Hetook it home therefore and the two children grew up together', 'And theone which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel because a birdhad carried it away', 'Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly thatwhen they did not see each other they were sad.Now the forester had an old cook who one evening took two pails andbegan to fetch water and did not go once only but many times outto the spring', 'Lina saw this and said Listen old Sanna why are youfetching so much water If you will never repeat it to anyone I willtell you why', 'So Lina said no she would never repeat it to anyoneand then the cook said Early tomorrow morning when the foresteris out hunting I will heat the water and when it is boiling in thekettle I will throw in Fundevogel and will boil him in it.Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting and when hewas gone the children were still in bed', 'Then Lina said to FundevogelIf you will never leave me I too will never leave you', 'Fundevogelsaid Neither now nor ever will I leave you', 'Then said Lina Thenwill I tell you', 'Last night old Sanna carried so many buckets of waterinto the house that I asked her why she was doing that and she saidthat if I would promise not to tell anyone and she said that earlytomorrow morning when father was out hunting she would set the kettlefull of water throw you into it and boil you but we will get upquickly dress ourselves and go away together.The two children therefore got up dressed themselves quickly and wentaway', 'When the water in the kettle was boiling the cook went into thebedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it', 'But when she came inand went to the beds both the children were gone', 'Then she was terriblyalarmed and she said to herself What shall I say now when theforester comes home and sees that the children are gone They must befollowed instantly to get them back again.Then the cook sent three servants after them who were to run andovertake the children', 'The children however were sitting outside theforest and when they saw from afar the three servants running Linasaid to Fundevogel Never leave me and I will never leave you.Fundevogel said Neither now nor ever', 'Then said Lina Do you becomea rosetree and I the rose upon it', 'When the three servants came tothe forest nothing was there but a rosetree and one rose on it butthe children were nowhere', 'Then said they There is nothing to be donehere and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothingin the forest but a little rosebush with one rose on it', 'Then theold cook scolded and said You simpletons you should have cut therosebush in two and have broken off the rose and brought it home withyou go and do it at once', 'They had therefore to go out and look forthe second time', 'The children however saw them coming from a distance.Then Lina said Fundevogel never leave me and I will never leaveyou', 'Fundevogel said Neither now nor ever', 'Said Lina Then do youbecome a church and Ill be the chandelier in it', 'So when the threeservants came nothing was there but a church with a chandelier init', 'They said therefore to each other What can we do here let us gohome', 'When they got home the cook asked if they had not found themso they said no they had found nothing but a church and there was achandelier in it', 'And the cook scolded them and said You fools whydid you not pull the church to pieces and bring the chandelier homewith you And now the old cook herself got on her legs and went withthe three servants in pursuit of the children', 'The children howeversaw from afar that the three servants were coming and the cook waddlingafter them', 'Then said Lina Fundevogel never leave me and I willnever leave you', 'Then said Fundevogel Neither now nor ever.Said Lina Be a fishpond and I will be the duck upon it', 'The cookhowever came up to them and when she saw the pond she lay down by itand was about to drink it up', 'But the duck swam quickly to her seizedher head in its beak and drew her into the water and there the oldwitch had to drown', 'Then the children went home together and wereheartily delighted and if they have not died they are living still.THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOROne summers morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by thewindow he was in good spirits and sewed with all his might', 'Then camea peasant woman down the street crying Good jams cheap Good jamscheap This rang pleasantly in the tailors ears he stretched hisdelicate head out of the window and called Come up here dear womanhere you will get rid of your goods', 'The woman came up the three stepsto the tailor with her heavy basket and he made her unpack all the potsfor him', 'He inspected each one lifted it up put his nose to it andat length said The jam seems to me to be good so weigh me out fourounces dear woman and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of noconsequence', 'The woman who had hoped to find a good sale gave himwhat he desired but went away quite angry and grumbling', 'Now this jamshall be blessed by God cried the little tailor and give me healthand strength so he brought the bread out of the cupboard cut himselfa piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it', 'This wonttaste bitter said he but I will just finish the jacket before Itake a bite', 'He laid the bread near him sewed on and in his joy madebigger and bigger stitches', 'In the meantime the smell of the sweet jamrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers and they wereattracted and descended on it in hosts', 'Hi who invited you said thelittle tailor and drove the unbidden guests away', 'The flies howeverwho understood no German would not be turned away but came backagain in everincreasing companies', 'The little tailor at last lost allpatience and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his worktableand saying Wait and I will give it to you struck it mercilessly onthem', 'When he drew it away and counted there lay before him no fewerthan seven dead and with legs stretched out', 'Are you a fellow of thatsort said he and could not help admiring his own bravery', 'The wholetown shall know of this And the little tailor hastened to cut himselfa girdle stitched it and embroidered on it in large letters Seven atone stroke What the town he continued the whole world shall hearof it and his heart wagged with joy like a lambs tail', 'The tailorput on the girdle and resolved to go forth into the world because hethought his workshop was too small for his valour', 'Before he went awayhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he couldtake with him however he found nothing but an old cheese and thathe put in his pocket', 'In front of the door he observed a bird whichhad caught itself in the thicket', 'It had to go into his pocket with thecheese', 'Now he took to the road boldly and as he was light and nimblehe felt no fatigue', 'The road led him up a mountain and when he hadreached the highest point of it there sat a powerful giant lookingpeacefully about him', 'The little tailor went bravely up spoke to himand said Good day comrade so you are sitting there overlooking thewidespread world I am just on my way thither and want to try my luck.Have you any inclination to go with me The giant looked contemptuouslyat the tailor and said You ragamuffin You miserable creatureOh indeed answered the little tailor and unbuttoned his coat andshowed the giant the girdle there may you read what kind of a man Iam The giant read Seven at one stroke and thought that they hadbeen men whom the tailor had killed and began to feel a little respectfor the tiny fellow', 'Nevertheless he wished to try him first and tooka stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped outof it', 'Do that likewise said the giant if you have strength', 'Isthat all said the tailor that is childs play with us and put hishand into his pocket brought out the soft cheese and pressed it untilthe liquid ran out of it', 'Faith said he that was a little betterwasnt it The giant did not know what to say and could not believe itof the little man', 'Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so highthat the eye could scarcely follow it', 'Now little mite of a man dothat likewise Well thrown said the tailor but after all the stonecame down to earth again I will throw you one which shall never comeback at all and he put his hand into his pocket took out the birdand threw it into the air', 'The bird delighted with its libertyrose flew away and did not come back', 'How does that shot please youcomrade asked the tailor', 'You can certainly throw said the giantbut now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly', 'Hetook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled onthe ground and said If you are strong enough help me to carry thetree out of the forest', 'Readily answered the little man take youthe trunk on your shoulders and I will raise up the branches and twigsafter all they are the heaviest', 'The giant took the trunk on hisshoulder but the tailor seated himself on a branch and the giant whocould not look round had to carry away the whole tree and the littletailor into the bargain he behind was quite merry and happy andwhistled the song Three tailors rode forth from the gate as ifcarrying the tree were childs play', 'The giant after he had dragged theheavy burden part of the way could go no further and cried Harkyou I shall have to let the tree fall The tailor sprang nimbly downseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it and saidto the giant You are such a great fellow and yet cannot even carrythe treeThey went on together and as they passed a cherrytree the giant laidhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging bent itdown gave it into the tailors hand and bade him eat', 'But the littletailor was much too weak to hold the tree and when the giant let it goit sprang back again and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.When he had fallen down again without injury the giant said What isthis Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig There is nolack of strength answered the little tailor', 'Do you think that couldbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow I leapt overthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.Jump as I did if you can do it', 'The giant made the attempt but hecould not get over the tree and remained hanging in the branches sothat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.The giant said If you are such a valiant fellow come with me into ourcavern and spend the night with us', 'The little tailor was willing andfollowed him', 'When they went into the cave other giants were sittingthere by the fire and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand andwas eating it', 'The little tailor looked round and thought It is muchmore spacious here than in my workshop', 'The giant showed him a bed andsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep', 'The bed however was toobig for the little tailor he did not lie down in it but crept intoa corner', 'When it was midnight and the giant thought that the littletailor was lying in a sound sleep he got up took a great iron barcut through the bed with one blow and thought he had finished off thegrasshopper for good', 'With the earliest dawn the giants went into theforest and had quite forgotten the little tailor when all at once hewalked up to them quite merrily and boldly', 'The giants were terrifiedthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead and ran away in agreat hurry.The little tailor went onwards always following his own pointed nose.After he had walked for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royalpalace and as he felt weary he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.Whilst he lay there the people came and inspected him on all sides andread on his girdle Seven at one stroke', 'Ah said they what doesthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace He must be a mightylord', 'They went and announced him to the king and gave it as theiropinion that if war should break out this would be a weighty and usefulman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart', 'The counsel pleasedthe king and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offerhim military service when he awoke', 'The ambassador remained standing bythe sleeper waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyesand then conveyed to him this proposal', 'For this very reason haveI come here the tailor replied I am ready to enter the kingsservice', 'He was therefore honourably received and a special dwellingwas assigned him.The soldiers however were set against the little tailor and wishedhim a thousand miles away', 'What is to be the end of this they saidamong themselves', 'If we quarrel with him and he strikes about himseven of us will fall at every blow not one of us can stand againsthim', 'They came therefore to a decision betook themselves in a body tothe king and begged for their dismissal', 'We are not prepared saidthey to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke', 'The king wassorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servantswished that he had never set eyes on the tailor and would willinglyhave been rid of him again', 'But he did not venture to give him hisdismissal for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his peopledead and place himself on the royal throne', 'He thought about it for along time and at last found good counsel', 'He sent to the little tailorand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior he had onerequest to make to him', 'In a forest of his country lived two giantswho caused great mischief with their robbing murdering ravagingand burning and no one could approach them without putting himself indanger of death', 'If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants hewould give him his only daughter to wife and half of his kingdom as adowry likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me thought thelittle tailor', 'One is not offered a beautiful princess and half akingdom every day of ones life Oh yes he replied I will soonsubdue the giants and do not require the help of the hundred horsemento do it he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid oftwo.The little tailor went forth and the hundred horsemen followed him.When he came to the outskirts of the forest he said to his followersJust stay waiting here I alone will soon finish off the giants', 'Thenhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left', 'After awhile he perceived both giants', 'They lay sleeping under a tree andsnored so that the branches waved up and down', 'The little tailor notidle gathered two pocketsful of stones and with these climbed up thetree', 'When he was halfway up he slipped down by a branch until he satjust above the sleepers and then let one stone after another fall onthe breast of one of the giants', 'For a long time the giant felt nothingbut at last he awoke pushed his comrade and said Why are youknocking me You must be dreaming said the other I am not knockingyou', 'They laid themselves down to sleep again and then the tailorthrew a stone down on the second', 'What is the meaning of this criedthe other Why are you pelting me I am not pelting you answeredthe first growling', 'They disputed about it for a time but as they wereweary they let the matter rest and their eyes closed once more', 'Thelittle tailor began his game again picked out the biggest stone andthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant', 'Thatis too bad cried he and sprang up like a madman and pushed hiscompanion against the tree until it shook', 'The other paid him back inthe same coin and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees andbelaboured each other so long that at last they both fell down dead onthe ground at the same time', 'Then the little tailor leapt down', 'It isa lucky thing said he that they did not tear up the tree on whichI was sitting or I should have had to sprint on to another like asquirrel but we tailors are nimble', 'He drew out his sword and gaveeach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast and then went out to thehorsemen and said The work is done I have finished both of themoff but it was hard work They tore up trees in their sore need anddefended themselves with them but all that is to no purpose when a manlike myself comes who can kill seven at one blow', 'But are you notwounded asked the horsemen', 'You need not concern yourself aboutthat answered the tailor they have not bent one hair of mine', 'Thehorsemen would not believe him and rode into the forest there theyfound the giants swimming in their blood and all round about lay thetornup trees.The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward he howeverrepented of his promise and again bethought himself how he could getrid of the hero', 'Before you receive my daughter and the half of mykingdom said he to him you must perform one more heroic deed', 'Inthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm and you must catchit first', 'I fear one unicorn still less than two giants', 'Seven at oneblow is my kind of affair', 'He took a rope and an axe with him wentforth into the forest and again bade those who were sent with him towait outside', 'He had not long to seek', 'The unicorn soon came towardshim and rushed directly on the tailor as if it would gore him with itshorn without more ado', 'Softly softly it cant be done as quickly asthat said he and stood still and waited until the animal was quiteclose and then sprang nimbly behind the tree', 'The unicorn ran againstthe tree with all its strength and stuck its horn so fast in the trunkthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again and thus itwas caught', 'Now I have got the bird said the tailor and came outfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck and then with hisaxe he hewed the horn out of the tree and when all was ready he led thebeast away and took it to the king.The king still would not give him the promised reward and made a thirddemand', 'Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar thatmade great havoc in the forest and the huntsmen should give him theirhelp', 'Willingly said the tailor that is childs play He did nottake the huntsmen with him into the forest and they were well pleasedthat he did not for the wild boar had several times received them insuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him', 'Whenthe boar perceived the tailor it ran on him with foaming mouth andwhetted tusks and was about to throw him to the ground but the herofled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window atonce and in one bound out again', 'The boar ran after him but the tailorran round outside and shut the door behind it and then the ragingbeast which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the windowwas caught', 'The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that theymight see the prisoner with their own eyes', 'The hero however went tothe king who was now whether he liked it or not obliged to keep hispromise and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom', 'Had he knownthat it was no warlike hero but a little tailor who was standing beforehim it would have gone to his heart still more than it did', 'The weddingwas held with great magnificence and small joy and out of a tailor aking was made.After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams atnight Boy make me the doublet and patch the pantaloons or else Iwill rap the yardmeasure over your ears', 'Then she discovered in whatstate of life the young lord had been born and next morning complainedof her wrongs to her father and begged him to help her to get rid ofher husband who was nothing else but a tailor', 'The king comforted herand said Leave your bedroom door open this night and my servantsshall stand outside and when he has fallen asleep shall go in bindhim and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wideworld', 'The woman was satisfied with this but the kings armourbearerwho had heard all was friendly with the young lord and informed him ofthe whole plot', 'Ill put a screw into that business said the littletailor', 'At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time andwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep she got up opened the doorand then lay down again', 'The little tailor who was only pretending tobe asleep began to cry out in a clear voice Boy make me the doubletand patch me the pantaloons or I will rap the yardmeasure over yourears', 'I smote seven at one blow', 'I killed two giants I brought away oneunicorn and caught a wild boar and am I to fear those who are standingoutside the room', 'When these men heard the tailor speaking thus theywere overcome by a great dread and ran as if the wild huntsman werebehind them and none of them would venture anything further againsthim', 'So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of hislife.HANSEL AND GRETELHard by a great forest dwelt a poor woodcutter with his wife and histwo children', 'The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel', 'He hadlittle to bite and to break and once when great dearth fell on theland he could no longer procure even daily bread', 'Now when he thoughtover this by night in his bed and tossed about in his anxiety hegroaned and said to his wife What is to become of us How are weto feed our poor children when we no longer have anything even forourselves Ill tell you what husband answered the woman earlytomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to whereit is the thickest there we will light a fire for them and give eachof them one more piece of bread and then we will go to our work andleave them alone', 'They will not find the way home again and we shall berid of them', 'No wife said the man I will not do that how can Ibear to leave my children alone in the forestthe wild animals wouldsoon come and tear them to pieces', 'O you fool said she then wemust all four die of hunger you may as well plane the planks for ourcoffins and she left him no peace until he consented', 'But I feel verysorry for the poor children all the same said the man.The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger and hadheard what their stepmother had said to their father', 'Gretel weptbitter tears and said to Hansel Now all is over with us', 'Be quietGretel said Hansel do not distress yourself I will soon find a wayto help us', 'And when the old folks had fallen asleep he got up puton his little coat opened the door below and crept outside', 'The moonshone brightly and the white pebbles which lay in front of the houseglittered like real silver pennies', 'Hansel stooped and stuffed thelittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in', 'Then he wentback and said to Gretel Be comforted dear little sister and sleep inpeace God will not forsake us and he lay down again in his bed', 'Whenday dawned but before the sun had risen the woman came and awoke thetwo children saying Get up you sluggards we are going into theforest to fetch wood', 'She gave each a little piece of bread and saidThere is something for your dinner but do not eat it up before thenfor you will get nothing else', 'Gretel took the bread under her apronas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket', 'Then they all set out togetheron the way to the forest', 'When they had walked a short time Hanselstood still and peeped back at the house and did so again and again.His father said Hansel what are you looking at there and stayingbehind for Pay attention and do not forget how to use your legs', 'Ahfather said Hansel I am looking at my little white cat which issitting up on the roof and wants to say goodbye to me', 'The wife saidFool that is not your little cat that is the morning sun which isshining on the chimneys', 'Hansel however had not been looking back atthe cat but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebblestonesout of his pocket on the road.When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said Nowchildren pile up some wood and I will light a fire that you may notbe cold', 'Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together as high as alittle hill', 'The brushwood was lighted and when the flames were burningvery high the woman said Now children lay yourselves down by thefire and rest we will go into the forest and cut some wood', 'When wehave done we will come back and fetch you away.Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire and when noon came each ate a littlepiece of bread and as they heard the strokes of the woodaxe theybelieved that their father was near', 'It was not the axe however buta branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind wasblowing backwards and forwards', 'And as they had been sitting such a longtime their eyes closed with fatigue and they fell fast asleep', 'Whenat last they awoke it was already dark night', 'Gretel began to cry andsaid How are we to get out of the forest now But Hansel comfortedher and said Just wait a little until the moon has risen and then wewill soon find the way', 'And when the full moon had risen Hansel tookhis little sister by the hand and followed the pebbles which shone likenewlycoined silver pieces and showed them the way.They walked the whole night long and by break of day came once moreto their fathers house', 'They knocked at the door and when the womanopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel she said You naughtychildren why have you slept so long in the forestwe thought you werenever coming back at all The father however rejoiced for it had cuthim to the heart to leave them behind alone.Not long afterwards there was once more great dearth throughout theland and the children heard their mother saying at night to theirfather Everything is eaten again we have one half loaf left and thatis the end', 'The children must go we will take them farther into thewood so that they will not find their way out again there is no othermeans of saving ourselves The mans heart was heavy and he thoughtIt would be better for you to share the last mouthful with yourchildren', 'The woman however would listen to nothing that he had tosay but scolded and reproached him', 'He who says A must say B likewiseand as he had yielded the first time he had to do so a second timealso.The children however were still awake and had heard the conversation.When the old folks were asleep Hansel again got up and wanted to goout and pick up pebbles as he had done before but the woman had lockedthe door and Hansel could not get out', 'Nevertheless he comforted hislittle sister and said Do not cry Gretel go to sleep quietly thegood God will help us.Early in the morning came the woman and took the children out of theirbeds', 'Their piece of bread was given to them but it was still smallerthan the time before', 'On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled hisin his pocket and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.Hansel why do you stop and look round said the father go on', 'Iam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof andwants to say goodbye to me answered Hansel', 'Fool said the womanthat is not your little pigeon that is the morning sun that is shiningon the chimney', 'Hansel however little by little threw all the crumbson the path.The woman led the children still deeper into the forest where they hadnever in their lives been before', 'Then a great fire was again made andthe mother said Just sit there you children and when you are tiredyou may sleep a little we are going into the forest to cut wood and inthe evening when we are done we will come and fetch you away', 'Whenit was noon Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel who hadscattered his by the way', 'Then they fell asleep and evening passed butno one came to the poor children', 'They did not awake until it was darknight and Hansel comforted his little sister and said Just waitGretel until the moon rises and then we shall see the crumbs of breadwhich I have strewn about they will show us our way home again', 'Whenthe moon came they set out but they found no crumbs for the manythousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had pickedthem all up', 'Hansel said to Gretel We shall soon find the way butthey did not find it', 'They walked the whole night and all the next daytoo from morning till evening but they did not get out of the forestand were very hungry for they had nothing to eat but two or threeberries which grew on the ground', 'And as they were so weary that theirlegs would carry them no longer they lay down beneath a tree and fellasleep.It was now three mornings since they had left their fathers house', 'Theybegan to walk again but they always came deeper into the forest and ifhelp did not come soon they must die of hunger and weariness', 'When itwas midday they saw a beautiful snowwhite bird sitting on a boughwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it', 'Andwhen its song was over it spread its wings and flew away before themand they followed it until they reached a little house on the roof ofwhich it alighted and when they approached the little house they sawthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes but that the windowswere of clear sugar', 'We will set to work on that said Hansel andhave a good meal', 'I will eat a bit of the roof and you Gretel can eatsome of the window it will taste sweet', 'Hansel reached up above andbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted and Gretel leantagainst the window and nibbled at the panes', 'Then a soft voice criedfrom the parlour Nibble nibble gnaw  Who is nibbling at my little houseThe children answered The wind the wind  The heavenborn windand went on eating without disturbing themselves', 'Hansel who liked thetaste of the roof tore down a great piece of it and Gretel pushed outthe whole of one round windowpane sat down and enjoyed herself withit', 'Suddenly the door opened and a woman as old as the hills whosupported herself on crutches came creeping out', 'Hansel and Gretel wereso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in theirhands', 'The old woman however nodded her head and said Oh you dearchildren who has brought you here do come in and stay with me', 'Noharm shall happen to you', 'She took them both by the hand and led theminto her little house', 'Then good food was set before them milk andpancakes with sugar apples and nuts', 'Afterwards two pretty littlebeds were covered with clean white linen and Hansel and Gretel lay downin them and thought they were in heaven.The old woman had only pretended to be so kind she was in realitya wicked witch who lay in wait for children and had only built thelittle house of bread in order to entice them there', 'When a child fellinto her power she killed it cooked and ate it and that was a feastday with her', 'Witches have red eyes and cannot see far but they havea keen scent like the beasts and are aware when human beings draw near.When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood she laughed withmalice and said mockingly I have them they shall not escape meagain Early in the morning before the children were awake she wasalready up and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking sopretty with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself Thatwill be a dainty mouthful Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelledhand carried him into a little stable and locked him in behind agrated door', 'Scream as he might it would not help him', 'Then she went toGretel shook her till she awoke and cried Get up lazy thing fetchsome water and cook something good for your brother he is in thestable outside and is to be made fat', 'When he is fat I will eat him.Gretel began to weep bitterly but it was all in vain for she wasforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel but Gretel got nothingbut crabshells', 'Every morning the woman crept to the little stable andcried Hansel stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soonbe fat', 'Hansel however stretched out a little bone to her andthe old woman who had dim eyes could not see it and thought it wasHansels finger and was astonished that there was no way of fatteninghim', 'When four weeks had gone by and Hansel still remained thin shewas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer', 'Now thenGretel she cried to the girl stir yourself and bring some water.Let Hansel be fat or lean tomorrow I will kill him and cook him', 'Ahhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the waterand how her tears did flow down her cheeks Dear God do help us shecried', 'If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us we shouldat any rate have died together', 'Just keep your noise to yourselfsaid the old woman it wont help you at all.Early in the morning Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron withthe water and light the fire', 'We will bake first said the old womanI have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough', 'She pushed poorGretel out to the oven from which flames of fire were already darting.Creep in said the witch and see if it is properly heated so thatwe can put the bread in', 'And once Gretel was inside she intended toshut the oven and let her bake in it and then she would eat her too.But Gretel saw what she had in mind and said I do not know how I amto do it how do I get in Silly goose said the old woman', 'The dooris big enough just look I can get in myself and she crept up andthrust her head into the oven', 'Then Gretel gave her a push that droveher far into it and shut the iron door and fastened the bolt', 'Oh thenshe began to howl quite horribly but Gretel ran away and the godlesswitch was miserably burnt to death.Gretel however ran like lightning to Hansel opened his little stableand cried Hansel we are saved The old witch is dead Then Hanselsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened', 'How they didrejoice and embrace each other and dance about and kiss each other Andas they had no longer any need to fear her they went into the witchshouse and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.These are far better than pebbles said Hansel and thrust into hispockets whatever could be got in and Gretel said I too will takesomething home with me and filled her pinafore full', 'But now we mustbe off said Hansel that we may get out of the witchs forest.When they had walked for two hours they came to a great stretch ofwater', 'We cannot cross said Hansel I see no footplank and nobridge', 'And there is also no ferry answered Gretel but a whiteduck is swimming there if I ask her she will help us over', 'Then shecried Little duck little duck dost thou see  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee  Theres never a plank or bridge in sight  Take us across on thy back so white.The duck came to them and Hansel seated himself on its back and toldhis sister to sit by him', 'No replied Gretel that will be too heavyfor the little duck she shall take us across one after the other', 'Thegood little duck did so and when they were once safely across and hadwalked for a short time the forest seemed to be more and more familiarto them and at length they saw from afar their fathers house', 'Thenthey began to run rushed into the parlour and threw themselves roundtheir fathers neck', 'The man had not known one happy hour since he hadleft the children in the forest the woman however was dead', 'Gretelemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about theroom and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket toadd to them', 'Then all anxiety was at an end and they lived togetherin perfect happiness', 'My tale is done there runs a mouse whosoevercatches it may make himself a big fur cap out of it.THE MOUSE THE BIRD AND THE SAUSAGEOnce upon a time a mouse a bird and a sausage entered intopartnership and set up house together', 'For a long time all went wellthey lived in great comfort and prospered so far as to be able to addconsiderably to their stores', 'The birds duty was to fly daily into thewood and bring in fuel the mouse fetched the water and the sausage sawto the cooking.When people are too well off they always begin to long for somethingnew', 'And so it came to pass that the bird while out one day met afellow bird to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of hishousehold arrangements', 'But the other bird sneered at him for being apoor simpleton who did all the hard work while the other two stayedat home and had a good time of it', 'For when the mouse had made the fireand fetched in the water she could retire into her little room and restuntil it was time to set the table', 'The sausage had only to watch thepot to see that the food was properly cooked and when it was neardinnertime he just threw himself into the broth or rolled in and outamong the vegetables three or four times and there they were butteredand salted and ready to be served', 'Then when the bird came home andhad laid aside his burden they sat down to table and when they hadfinished their meal they could sleep their fill till the followingmorning and that was really a very delightful life.Influenced by those remarks the bird next morning refused to bring inthe wood telling the others that he had been their servant long enoughand had been a fool into the bargain and that it was now time to make achange and to try some other way of arranging the work', 'Beg and prayas the mouse and the sausage might it was of no use the bird remainedmaster of the situation and the venture had to be made', 'They thereforedrew lots and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood to the mouseto cook and to the bird to fetch the water.And now what happened The sausage started in search of wood the birdmade the fire and the mouse put on the pot and then these two waitedtill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day', 'But thesausage remained so long away that they became uneasy and the birdflew out to meet him', 'He had not flown far however when he came acrossa dog who having met the sausage had regarded him as his legitimatebooty and so seized and swallowed him', 'The bird complained to the dogof this barefaced robbery but nothing he said was of any avail forthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage andthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.He picked up the wood and flew sadly home and told the mouse all hehad seen and heard', 'They were both very unhappy but agreed to make thebest of things and to remain with one another.So now the bird set the table and the mouse looked after the food andwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage by rolling in andout among the vegetables to salt and butter them she jumped into thepot but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom havingalready parted not only with her skin and hair but also with life.Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner but hecould nowhere see the cook', 'In his alarm and flurry he threw the woodhere and there about the floor called and searched but no cook was tobe found', 'Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown downcaught fire and began to blaze', 'The bird hastened to fetch some waterbut his pail fell into the well and he after it and as he was unableto recover himself he was drowned.MOTHER HOLLEOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters one of themwas beautiful and industrious the other ugly and lazy', 'The motherhowever loved the ugly and lazy one best because she was her owndaughter and so the other who was only her stepdaughter was madeto do all the work of the house and was quite the Cinderella of thefamily', 'Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well inthe high road there to spin until she made her fingers bleed', 'Now itchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle and as the girlstopped over the well to wash it off the spindle suddenly sprang outof her hand and fell into the well', 'She ran home crying to tell of hermisfortune but her stepmother spoke harshly to her and after givingher a violent scolding said unkindly As you have let the spindle fallinto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do and at last inher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in abeautiful meadow full of sunshine and with countless flowers bloomingin every direction.She walked over the meadow and presently she came upon a bakers ovenfull of bread and the loaves cried out to her Take us out take usout or alas we shall be burnt to a cinder we were baked through longago', 'So she took the breadshovel and drew them all out.She went on a little farther till she came to a tree full of apples.Shake me shake me I pray cried the tree my apples one and allare ripe', 'So she shook the tree and the apples came falling down uponher like rain but she continued shaking until there was not a singleapple left upon it', 'Then she carefully gathered the apples together in aheap and walked on again.The next thing she came to was a little house and there she saw an oldwoman looking out with such large teeth that she was terrified andturned to run away', 'But the old woman called after her What are youafraid of dear child Stay with me if you will do the work of my houseproperly for me I will make you very happy', 'You must be very carefulhowever to make my bed in the right way for I wish you always to shakeit thoroughly so that the feathers fly about then they say down therein the world that it is snowing for I am Mother Holle', 'The old womanspoke so kindly that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enterinto her service.She took care to do everything according to the old womans bidding andevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might so that thefeathers flew about like so many snowflakes', 'The old woman was as goodas her word she never spoke angrily to her and gave her roast andboiled meats every day.So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time and then she beganto grow unhappy', 'She could not at first tell why she felt sad but shebecame conscious at last of great longing to go home then she knew shewas homesick although she was a thousand times better off with MotherHolle than with her mother and sister', 'After waiting awhile she wentto Mother Holle and said I am so homesick that I cannot stay withyou any longer for although I am so happy here I must return to my ownpeople.Then Mother Holle said I am pleased that you should want to go backto your own people and as you have served me so well and faithfully Iwill take you home myself.Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway', 'The gatewas opened and as the girl passed through a shower of gold fell uponher and the gold clung to her so that she was covered with it fromhead to foot.That is a reward for your industry said Mother Holle and as shespoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.The gate was then closed and the girl found herself back in the oldworld close to her mothers house', 'As she entered the courtyard thecock who was perched on the well called out Cockadoodledoo  Your golden daughters come back to you.Then she went in to her mother and sister and as she was so richlycovered with gold they gave her a warm welcome', 'She related to themall that had happened and when the mother heard how she had come by hergreat riches she thought she should like her ugly lazy daughter to goand try her fortune', 'So she made the sister go and sit by the welland spin and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into athornbush so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle thenshe threw it into the well and jumped in herself.Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow and walked over ittill she came to the oven', 'Take us out take us out or alas we shallbe burnt to a cinder we were baked through long ago cried the loavesas before', 'But the lazy girl answered Do you think I am going to dirtymy hands for you and walked on.Presently she came to the appletree', 'Shake me shake me I pray myapples one and all are ripe it cried', 'But she only answered A nicething to ask me to do one of the apples might fall on my head andpassed on.At last she came to Mother Holles house and as she had heard all aboutthe large teeth from her sister she was not afraid of them and engagedherself without delay to the old woman.The first day she was very obedient and industrious and exerted herselfto please Mother Holle for she thought of the gold she should get inreturn', 'The next day however she began to dawdle over her work andthe third day she was more idle still then she began to lie in bed inthe mornings and refused to get up', 'Worse still she neglected tomake the old womans bed properly and forgot to shake it so that thefeathers might fly about', 'So Mother Holle very soon got tired of herand told her she might go', 'The lazy girl was delighted at this andthought to herself The gold will soon be mine', 'Mother Holle led heras she had led her sister to the broad gateway but as she was passingthrough instead of the shower of gold a great bucketful of pitch camepouring over her.That is in return for your services said the old woman and she shutthe gate.So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch and the cock on thewell called out as she saw her Cockadoodledoo  Your dirty daughters come back to you.But try what she would she could not get the pitch off and it stuck toher as long as she lived.LITTLE REDCAP LITTLE RED RIDING HOODOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyonewho looked at her but most of all by her grandmother and there wasnothing that she would not have given to the child', 'Once she gave her alittle cap of red velvet which suited her so well that she would neverwear anything else so she was always called Little RedCap.One day her mother said to her Come Little RedCap here is a pieceof cake and a bottle of wine take them to your grandmother she is illand weak and they will do her good', 'Set out before it gets hot andwhen you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the pathor you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother willget nothing and when you go into her room dont forget to say Goodmorning and dont peep into every corner before you do it.I will take great care said Little RedCap to her mother and gaveher hand on it.The grandmother lived out in the wood half a league from the villageand just as Little RedCap entered the wood a wolf met her', 'RedCapdid not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid ofhim.Good day Little RedCap said he.Thank you kindly wolf.Whither away so early Little RedCapTo my grandmothers.What have you got in your apronCake and wine yesterday was bakingday so poor sick grandmother is tohave something good to make her stronger.Where does your grandmother live Little RedCapA good quarter of a league farther on in the wood her house standsunder the three large oaktrees the nuttrees are just below yousurely must know it replied Little RedCap.The wolf thought to himself What a tender young creature what a niceplump mouthfulshe will be better to eat than the old woman', 'I mustact craftily so as to catch both', 'So he walked for a short time bythe side of Little RedCap and then he said See Little RedCap howpretty the flowers are about herewhy do you not look round I believetoo that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing youwalk gravely along as if you were going to school while everything elseout here in the wood is merry.Little RedCap raised her eyes and when she saw the sunbeams dancinghere and there through the trees and pretty flowers growing everywhereshe thought Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay that wouldplease her too', 'It is so early in the day that I shall still get therein good time and so she ran from the path into the wood to look forflowers', 'And whenever she had picked one she fancied that she saw astill prettier one farther on and ran after it and so got deeper anddeeper into the wood.Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmothers house and knockedat the door.Who is thereLittle RedCap replied the wolf', 'She is bringing cake and wine openthe door.Lift the latch called out the grandmother I am too weak and cannotget up.The wolf lifted the latch the door sprang open and without saying aword he went straight to the grandmothers bed and devoured her', 'Thenhe put on her clothes dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bedand drew the curtains.Little RedCap however had been running about picking flowersand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more sheremembered her grandmother and set out on the way to her.She was surprised to find the cottagedoor standing open and when shewent into the room she had such a strange feeling that she said toherself Oh dear how uneasy I feel today and at other times I likebeing with grandmother so much', 'She called out Good morning butreceived no answer so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face andlooking very strange.Oh grandmother she said what big ears you haveThe better to hear you with my child was the reply.But grandmother what big eyes you have she said.The better to see you with my dear.But grandmother what large hands you haveThe better to hug you with.Oh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you haveThe better to eat you withAnd scarcely had the wolf said this than with one bound he was out ofbed and swallowed up RedCap.When the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bedfell asleep and began to snore very loud', 'The huntsman was just passingthe house and thought to himself How the old woman is snoring I mustjust see if she wants anything', 'So he went into the room and when hecame to the bed he saw that the wolf was lying in it', 'Do I find youhere you old sinner said he', 'I have long sought you Then just ashe was going to fire at him it occurred to him that the wolf might havedevoured the grandmother and that she might still be saved so he didnot fire but took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the stomachof the sleeping wolf', 'When he had made two snips he saw the littleRedCap shining and then he made two snips more and the little girlsprang out crying Ah how frightened I have been How dark it wasinside the wolf and after that the aged grandmother came out alivealso but scarcely able to breathe', 'RedCap however quickly fetchedgreat stones with which they filled the wolfs belly and when he awokehe wanted to run away but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed atonce and fell dead.Then all three were delighted', 'The huntsman drew off the wolfs skin andwent home with it the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine whichRedCap had brought and revived but RedCap thought to herself Aslong as I live I will never by myself leave the path to run into thewood when my mother has forbidden me to do so.It also related that once when RedCap was again taking cakes to the oldgrandmother another wolf spoke to her and tried to entice her from thepath', 'RedCap however was on her guard and went straight forward onher way and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf and that hehad said good morning to her but with such a wicked look in his eyesthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he wouldhave eaten her up', 'Well said the grandmother we will shut the doorthat he may not come in', 'Soon afterwards the wolf knocked and criedOpen the door grandmother I am Little RedCap and am bringing yousome cakes', 'But they did not speak or open the door so the greybeardstole twice or thrice round the house and at last jumped on the roofintending to wait until RedCap went home in the evening and then tosteal after her and devour her in the darkness', 'But the grandmothersaw what was in his thoughts', 'In front of the house was a great stonetrough so she said to the child Take the pail RedCap I made somesausages yesterday so carry the water in which I boiled them to thetrough', 'RedCap carried until the great trough was quite full', 'Then thesmell of the sausages reached the wolf and he sniffed and peeped downand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keephis footing and began to slip and slipped down from the roof straightinto the great trough and was drowned', 'But RedCap went joyously homeand no one ever did anything to harm her again.THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOMThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter and as she wasgrown up he was anxious that she should be well married and providedfor', 'He said to himself I will give her to the first suitable man whocomes and asks for her hand', 'Not long after a suitor appeared and ashe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him withwhich to find fault he betrothed his daughter to him', 'But the girl didnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.She did not feel that she could trust him and she could not look at himnor think of him without an inward shudder', 'One day he said to her Youhave not yet paid me a visit although we have been betrothed for sometime', 'I do not know where your house is she answered', 'My house isout there in the dark forest he said', 'She tried to excuse herself bysaying that she would not be able to find the way thither', 'Her betrothedonly replied You must come and see me next Sunday I have alreadyinvited guests for that day and that you may not mistake the way Iwill strew ashes along the path.When Sunday came and it was time for the girl to start a feeling ofdread came over her which she could not explain and that she mightbe able to find her path again she filled her pockets with peas andlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along', 'On reaching theentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes and theseshe followed throwing down some peas on either side of her at everystep she took', 'She walked the whole day until she came to the deepestdarkest part of the forest', 'There she saw a lonely house looking sogrim and mysterious that it did not please her at all', 'She steppedinside but not a soul was to be seen and a great silence reignedthroughout', 'Suddenly a voice cried Turn back turn back young maiden fair  Linger not in this murderers lair.The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in acage on the wall', 'Again it cried Turn back turn back young maiden fair  Linger not in this murderers lair.The girl passed on going from room to room of the house but they wereall empty and still she saw no one', 'At last she came to the cellarand there sat a very very old woman who could not keep her head fromshaking', 'Can you tell me asked the girl if my betrothed husbandlives hereAh you poor child answered the old woman what a place for you tocome to This is a murderers den', 'You think yourself a promised brideand that your marriage will soon take place but it is with death thatyou will keep your marriage feast', 'Look do you see that large cauldronof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire As soon as they haveyou in their power they will kill you without mercy and cook and eatyou for they are eaters of men', 'If I did not take pity on you and saveyou you would be lost.Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask which quite hid herfrom view', 'Keep as still as a mouse she said do not move or speakor it will be all over with you', 'Tonight when the robbers areall asleep we will flee together', 'I have long been waiting for anopportunity to escape.The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returneddragging another young girl along with them', 'They were all drunk andpaid no heed to her cries and lamentations', 'They gave her wine to drinkthree glasses full one of white wine one of red and one of yellowand with that her heart gave way and she died', 'Then they tore off herdainty clothing laid her on a table and cut her beautiful body intopieces and sprinkled salt upon it.The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind thecask for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her bythe robbers', 'One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining onthe little finger of the murdered girl and as he could not draw it offeasily he took a hatchet and cut off the finger but the finger spranginto the air and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who washiding there', 'The robber took a light and began looking for it but hecould not find it', 'Have you looked behind the large cask said one ofthe others', 'But the old woman called out Come and eat your suppersand let the thing be till tomorrow the finger wont run away.The old woman is right said the robbers and they ceased looking forthe finger and sat down.The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine and beforelong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar fast asleep andsnoring', 'As soon as the girl was assured of this she came from behindthe cask', 'She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers whowere lying close together and every moment she was filled with reneweddread lest she should awaken them', 'But God helped her so that shepassed safely over them and then she and the old woman went upstairsopened the door and hastened as fast as they could from the murderersden', 'They found the ashes scattered by the wind but the peas andlentils had sprouted and grown sufficiently above the ground to guidethem in the moonlight along the path', 'All night long they walked and itwas morning before they reached the mill', 'Then the girl told her fatherall that had happened.The day came that had been fixed for the marriage', 'The bridegroomarrived and also a large company of guests for the miller had takencare to invite all his friends and relations', 'As they sat at the feasteach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale the bride sat still and didnot say a word.And you my love said the bridegroom turning to her is there notale you know Tell us something.I will tell you a dream then said the bride', 'I went alone through aforest and came at last to a house not a soul could I find within buta bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried Turn back turn back young maiden fair  Linger not in this murderers lair.and again a second time it said these words.My darling this is only a dream.I went on through the house from room to room but they were all emptyand everything was so grim and mysterious', 'At last I went down to thecellar and there sat a very very old woman who could not keep herhead still', 'I asked her if my betrothed lived here and she answeredAh you poor child you are come to a murderers den your betrotheddoes indeed live here but he will kill you without mercy and afterwardscook and eat you.My darling this is only a dream.The old woman hid me behind a large cask and scarcely had she donethis when the robbers returned home dragging a young girl along withthem', 'They gave her three kinds of wine to drink white red andyellow and with that she died.My darling this is only a dream.Then they tore off her dainty clothing and cut her beautiful body intopieces and sprinkled salt upon it.My darling this is only a dream.And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on herfinger and as it was difficult to draw off he took a hatchet and cutoff her finger but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind thegreat cask into my lap', 'And here is the finger with the ring', 'Andwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to theassembled guests.The bridegroom who during this recital had grown deadly pale up andtried to escape but the guests seized him and held him fast', 'Theydelivered him up to justice and he and all his murderous band werecondemned to death for their wicked deeds.TOM THUMBA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night smoking his pipe by thefireside while his wife sat by his side spinning', 'How lonely it iswife said he as he puffed out a long curl of smoke for you and meto sit here by ourselves without any children to play about and amuseus while other people seem so happy and merry with their childrenWhat you say is very true said the wife sighing and turning roundher wheel how happy should I be if I had but one child If it wereever so smallnay if it were no bigger than my thumbI should be veryhappy and love it dearly', 'Nowodd as you may think itit came topass that this good womans wish was fulfilled just in the very way shehad wished it for not long afterwards she had a little boy who wasquite healthy and strong but was not much bigger than my thumb', 'Sothey said Well we cannot say we have not got what we wished for andlittle as he is we will love him dearly', 'And they called him ThomasThumb.They gave him plenty of food yet for all they could do he never grewbigger but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.Still his eyes were sharp and sparkling and he soon showed himself tobe a clever little fellow who always knew well what he was about.One day as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cutfuel he said I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me for Iwant to make haste', 'Oh father cried Tom I will take care of thatthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it', 'Then the woodmanlaughed and said How can that be you cannot reach up to the horsesbridle', 'Never mind that father said Tom if my mother will onlyharness the horse I will get into his ear and tell him which way togo', 'Well said the father we will try for once.When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart and putTom into his ear and as he sat there the little man told the beast howto go crying out Go on and Stop as he wanted and thus the horsewent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into thewood', 'It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast and Tomwas calling out Gently gently two strangers came up', 'What an oddthing that is said one there is a cart going along and I hear acarter talking to the horse but yet I can see no one', 'That is queerindeed said the other let us follow the cart and see where itgoes', 'So they went on into the wood till at last they came to theplace where the woodman was', 'Then Tom Thumb seeing his father criedout See father here I am with the cart all right and safe now takeme down So his father took hold of the horse with one hand and withthe other took his son out of the horses ear and put him down upon astraw where he sat as merry as you please.The two strangers were all this time looking on and did not know whatto say for wonder', 'At last one took the other aside and said Thatlittle urchin will make our fortune if we can get him and carry himabout from town to town as a show we must buy him', 'So they went up tothe woodman and asked him what he would take for the little man', 'Hewill be better off said they with us than with you', 'I wont sellhim at all said the father my own flesh and blood is dearer to methan all the silver and gold in the world', 'But Tom hearing of thebargain they wanted to make crept up his fathers coat to his shoulderand whispered in his ear Take the money father and let them have meIll soon come back to you.So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for alarge piece of gold and they paid the price', 'Where would you like tosit said one of them', 'Oh put me on the rim of your hat that will bea nice gallery for me I can walk about there and see the country as wego along', 'So they did as he wished and when Tom had taken leave of hisfather they took him away with them.They journeyed on till it began to be dusky and then the little mansaid Let me get down Im tired', 'So the man took off his hat andput him down on a clod of earth in a ploughed field by the side of theroad', 'But Tom ran about amongst the furrows and at last slipped intoan old mousehole', 'Good night my masters said he Im off mind andlook sharp after me the next time', 'Then they ran at once to the placeand poked the ends of their sticks into the mousehole but all in vainTom only crawled farther and farther in and at last it became quitedark so that they were forced to go their way without their prize assulky as could be.When Tom found they were gone he came out of his hidingplace', 'Whatdangerous walking it is said he in this ploughed field If I were tofall from one of these great clods I should undoubtedly break my neck.At last by good luck he found a large empty snailshell', 'This islucky said he I can sleep here very well and in he crept.Just as he was falling asleep he heard two men passing by chattingtogether and one said to the other How can we rob that rich parsonshouse of his silver and gold Ill tell you cried Tom', 'What noisewas that said the thief frightened Im sure I heard someone speak.They stood still listening and Tom said Take me with you and Illsoon show you how to get the parsons money', 'But where are you saidthey', 'Look about on the ground answered he and listen where thesound comes from', 'At last the thieves found him out and lifted himup in their hands', 'You little urchin they said what can you do forus Why I can get between the iron windowbars of the parsons houseand throw you out whatever you want', 'Thats a good thought said thethieves come along we shall see what you can do.When they came to the parsons house Tom slipped through thewindowbars into the room and then called out as loud as he could bawlWill you have all that is here At this the thieves were frightenedand said Softly softly Speak low that you may not awaken anybody.But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them and bawled out againHow much will you have Shall I throw it all out Now the cook lay inthe next room and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed andlistened', 'Meantime the thieves were frightened and ran off a littleway but at last they plucked up their hearts and said The littleurchin is only trying to make fools of us', 'So they came back andwhispered softly to him saying Now let us have no more of yourroguish jokes but throw us out some of the money', 'Then Tom called outas loud as he could Very well hold your hands here it comes.The cook heard this quite plain so she sprang out of bed and ran toopen the door', 'The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails andthe maid having groped about and found nothing went away for a light.By the time she came back Tom had slipped off into the barn and whenshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner and foundnobody she went to bed thinking she must have been dreaming with hereyes open.The little man crawled about in the hayloft and at last found a snugplace to finish his nights rest in so he laid himself down meaningto sleep till daylight and then find his way home to his father andmother', 'But alas how woefully he was undone what crosses and sorrowshappen to us all in this world The cook got up early before daybreakto feed the cows and going straight to the hayloft carried awaya large bundle of hay with the little man in the middle of it fastasleep', 'He still however slept on and did not awake till he foundhimself in the mouth of the cow for the cook had put the hay into thecows rick and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it', 'Goodlackaday said he how came I to tumble into the mill But he soonfound out where he really was and was forced to have all his wits abouthim that he might not get between the cows teeth and so be crushed todeath', 'At last down he went into her stomach', 'It is rather dark saidhe they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in acandle would be no bad thing.Though he made the best of his bad luck he did not like his quarters atall and the worst of it was that more and more hay was always comingdown and the space left for him became smaller and smaller', 'At last hecried out as loud as he could Dont bring me any more hay Dont bringme any more hayThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow and hearing someonespeak but seeing nobody and yet being quite sure it was the same voicethat she had heard in the night she was so frightened that she fell offher stool and overset the milkpail', 'As soon as she could pick herselfup out of the dirt she ran off as fast as she could to her master theparson and said Sir sir the cow is talking But the parsonsaid Woman thou art surely mad However he went with her into thecowhouse to try and see what was the matter.Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold when Tom called out Dontbring me any more hay Then the parson himself was frightened andthinking the cow was surely bewitched told his man to kill her on thespot', 'So the cow was killed and cut up and the stomach in which Tomlay was thrown out upon a dunghill.Tom soon set himself to work to get out which was not a very easytask but at last just as he had made room to get his head out freshillluck befell him', 'A hungry wolf sprang out and swallowed up thewhole stomach with Tom in it at one gulp and ran away.Tom however was still not disheartened and thinking the wolf wouldnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along he calledout My good friend I can show you a famous treat', 'Wheres thatsaid the wolf', 'In such and such a house said Tom describing his ownfathers house', 'You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen andthen into the pantry and there you will find cakes ham beef coldchicken roast pig appledumplings and everything that your heart canwish.The wolf did not want to be asked twice so that very night he went tothe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen and then intothe pantry and ate and drank there to his hearts content', 'As soon ashe had had enough he wanted to get away but he had eaten so much thathe could not go out by the same way he came in.This was just what Tom had reckoned upon and now he began to set up agreat shout making all the noise he could', 'Will you be easy said thewolf youll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.Whats that to me said the little man you have had your frolic nowIve a mind to be merry myself and he began singing and shouting asloud as he could.The woodman and his wife being awakened by the noise peeped througha crack in the door but when they saw a wolf was there you may wellsuppose that they were sadly frightened and the woodman ran for hisaxe and gave his wife a scythe', 'Do you stay behind said the woodmanand when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with thescythe', 'Tom heard all this and cried out Father father I am herethe wolf has swallowed me', 'And his father said Heaven be praised wehave found our dear child again and he told his wife not to use thescythe for fear she should hurt him', 'Then he aimed a great blow andstruck the wolf on the head and killed him on the spot and when he wasdead they cut open his body and set Tommy free', 'Ah said the fatherwhat fears we have had for you Yes father answered he I havetravelled all over the world I think in one way or other since weparted and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.Why where have you been said his father', 'I have been in amouseholeand in a snailshelland down a cows throatand in thewolfs belly and yet here I am again safe and sound.Well said they you are come back and we will not sell you againfor all the riches in the world.Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son and gave him plentyto eat and drink for he was very hungry and then they fetched newclothes for him for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother in peace forthough he had been so great a traveller and had done and seen so manyfine things and was fond enough of telling the whole story he alwaysagreed that after all theres no place like HOMERUMPELSTILTSKINBy the side of a wood in a country a long way off ran a fine streamof water and upon the stream there stood a mill', 'The millers house wasclose by and the miller you must know had a very beautiful daughter.She was moreover very shrewd and clever and the miller was so proudof her that he one day told the king of the land who used to come andhunt in the wood that his daughter could spin gold out of straw', 'Nowthis king was very fond of money and when he heard the millers boasthis greediness was raised and he sent for the girl to be brought beforehim', 'Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a greatheap of straw and gave her a spinningwheel and said All this mustbe spun into gold before morning as you love your life', 'It was in vainthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her fatherfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold the chamberdoor was locked and she was left alone.She sat down in one corner of the room and began to bewail her hardfate when on a sudden the door opened and a drolllooking little manhobbled in and said Good morrow to you my good lass what are youweeping for Alas said she I must spin this straw into gold andI know not how', 'What will you give me said the hobgoblin to do itfor you My necklace replied the maiden', 'He took her at her wordand sat himself down to the wheel and whistled and sang Round about round about    Lo and behold  Reel away reel away    Straw into goldAnd round about the wheel went merrily the work was quickly done andthe straw was all spun into gold.When the king came and saw this he was greatly astonished and pleasedbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain and he shut up the poormillers daughter again with a fresh task', 'Then she knew not what to doand sat down once more to weep but the dwarf soon opened the door andsaid What will you give me to do your task The ring on my fingersaid she', 'So her little friend took the ring and began to work at thewheel again and whistled and sang Round about round about    Lo and behold  Reel away reel away    Straw into goldtill long before morning all was done again.The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasurebut still he had not enough so he took the millers daughter to a yetlarger heap and said All this must be spun tonight and if it isyou shall be my queen', 'As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in andsaid What will you give me to spin gold for you this third timeI have nothing left said she', 'Then say you will give me saidthe little man the first little child that you may have when you arequeen', 'That may never be thought the millers daughter and as sheknew no other way to get her task done she said she would do what heasked', 'Round went the wheel again to the old song and the manikin oncemore spun the heap into gold', 'The king came in the morning and findingall he wanted was forced to keep his word so he married the millersdaughter and she really became queen.At the birth of her first little child she was very glad and forgot thedwarf and what she had said', 'But one day he came into her room whereshe was sitting playing with her baby and put her in mind of it', 'Thenshe grieved sorely at her misfortune and said she would give him allthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off but in vain till atlast her tears softened him and he said I will give you three daysgrace and if during that time you tell me my name you shall keep yourchild.Now the queen lay awake all night thinking of all the odd names thatshe had ever heard and she sent messengers all over the land to findout new ones', 'The next day the little man came and she began withTIMOTHY ICHABOD BENJAMIN JEREMIAH and all the names she couldremember but to all and each of them he said Madam that is not myname.The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear ofBANDYLEGS HUNCHBACK CROOKSHANKS and so on but the little gentlemanstill said to every one of them Madam that is not my name.The third day one of the messengers came back and said I havetravelled two days without hearing of any other names but yesterday asI was climbing a high hill among the trees of the forest where the foxand the hare bid each other good night I saw a little hut and beforethe hut burnt a fire and round about the fire a funny little dwarf wasdancing upon one leg and singing Merrily the feast Ill make', ' Today Ill brew tomorrow bake  Merrily Ill dance and sing  For next day will a stranger bring', ' Little does my lady dream  Rumpelstiltskin is my nameWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy and as soon as her littlefriend came she sat down upon her throne and called all her court roundto enjoy the fun and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in herarms as if it was quite ready to be given up', 'Then the little man beganto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child to take home withhim to his hut in the woods and he cried out Now lady what is myname Is it JOHN asked she', 'No madam Is it TOM No madamIs it JEMMY It is not', 'Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN said thelady slyly', 'Some witch told you thatsome witch told you that criedthe little man and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into thefloor that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull itout.Then he made the best of his way off while the nurse laughed and thebaby crowed and all the court jeered at him for having had so muchtrouble for nothing and said We wish you a very good morning and amerry feast Mr RUMPLESTILTSKINCLEVER GRETELThere was once a cook named Gretel who wore shoes with red heels andwhen she walked out with them on she turned herself this way and thatwas quite happy and thought You certainly are a pretty girl And whenshe came home she drank in her gladness of heart a draught of wineand as wine excites a desire to eat she tasted the best of whatever shewas cooking until she was satisfied and said The cook must know whatthe food is like.It came to pass that the master one day said to her Gretel there is aguest coming this evening prepare me two fowls very daintily', 'I willsee to it master answered Gretel', 'She killed two fowls scalded themplucked them put them on the spit and towards evening set them beforethe fire that they might roast', 'The fowls began to turn brown and werenearly ready but the guest had not yet arrived', 'Then Gretel called outto her master If the guest does not come I must take the fowls awayfrom the fire but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eatenthe moment they are at their juiciest', 'The master said I will runmyself and fetch the guest', 'When the master had turned his backGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side and thought Standingso long by the fire there makes one sweat and thirsty who knowswhen they will come Meanwhile I will run into the cellar and take adrink', 'She ran down set a jug said God bless it for you Greteland took a good drink and thought that wine should flow on and shouldnot be interrupted and took yet another hearty draught.Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire basted themand drove the spit merrily round', 'But as the roast meat smelt so goodGretel thought Something might be wrong it ought to be tastedShe touched it with her finger and said Ah how good fowls are Itcertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the righttime She ran to the window to see if the master was not coming withhis guest but she saw no one and went back to the fowls and thoughtOne of the wings is burning I had better take it off and eat it.So she cut it off ate it and enjoyed it and when she had done shethought The other must go down too or else master will observe thatsomething is missing', 'When the two wings were eaten she went andlooked for her master and did not see him', 'It suddenly occurred toher Who knows They are perhaps not coming at all and have turned insomewhere', 'Then she said Well Gretel enjoy yourself one fowl hasbeen cut into take another drink and eat it up entirely when it iseaten you will have some peace why should Gods good gifts be spoiltSo she ran into the cellar again took an enormous drink and ate up theone chicken in great glee', 'When one of the chickens was swallowed downand still her master did not come Gretel looked at the other and saidWhat one is the other should be likewise the two go together whatsright for the one is right for the other I think if I were to takeanother draught it would do me no harm', 'So she took another heartydrink and let the second chicken follow the first.While she was making the most of it her master came and cried Hurryup Gretel the guest is coming directly after me Yes sir I willsoon serve up answered Gretel', 'Meantime the master looked to see thatthe table was properly laid and took the great knife wherewith he wasgoing to carve the chickens and sharpened it on the steps', 'Presentlythe guest came and knocked politely and courteously at the housedoor.Gretel ran and looked to see who was there and when she saw the guestshe put her finger to her lips and said Hush hush go away as quicklyas you can if my master catches you it will be the worse for you hecertainly did ask you to supper but his intention is to cut off yourtwo ears', 'Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it The guestheard the sharpening and hurried down the steps again as fast as hecould', 'Gretel was not idle she ran screaming to her master and criedYou have invited a fine guest Why Gretel What do you mean bythat Yes said she he has taken the chickens which I was justgoing to serve up off the dish and has run away with them Thats anice trick said her master and lamented the fine chickens', 'If he hadbut left me one so that something remained for me to eat', 'He called tohim to stop but the guest pretended not to hear', 'Then he ran after himwith the knife still in his hand crying Just one just one meaningthat the guest should leave him just one chicken and not take both', 'Theguest however thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one ofhis ears and ran as if fire were burning under him in order to takethem both with him.THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSONThere was once a very old man whose eyes had become dim his ears dullof hearing his knees trembled and when he sat at table he could hardlyhold the spoon and spilt the broth upon the tablecloth or let it runout of his mouth', 'His son and his sons wife were disgusted at this sothe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stoveand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl and not even enoughof it', 'And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full oftears', 'Once too his trembling hands could not hold the bowl and itfell to the ground and broke', 'The young wife scolded him but he saidnothing and only sighed', 'Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a fewhalfpence out of which he had to eat.They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years oldbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground', 'What areyou doing there asked the father', 'I am making a little troughanswered the child for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.The man and his wife looked at each other for a while and presentlybegan to cry', 'Then they took the old grandfather to the table andhenceforth always let him eat with them and likewise said nothing if hedid spill a little of anything.THE LITTLE PEASANTThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really richpeasants and just one poor one whom they called the little peasant', 'Hehad not even so much as a cow and still less money to buy one andyet he and his wife did so wish to have one', 'One day he said to herListen I have a good idea there is our gossip the carpenter he shallmake us a wooden calf and paint it brown so that it looks like anyother and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow', 'the womanalso liked the idea and their gossip the carpenter cut and planedthe calf and painted it as it ought to be and made it with its headhanging down as if it were eating.Next morning when the cows were being driven out the little peasantcalled the cowherd in and said Look I have a little calf therebut it is still small and has to be carried', 'The cowherd said Allright and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture and setit among the grass', 'The little calf always remained standing like onewhich was eating and the cowherd said It will soon run by itselfjust look how it eats already At night when he was going to drive theherd home again he said to the calf If you can stand there and eatyour fill you can also go on your four legs I dont care to drag youhome again in my arms', 'But the little peasant stood at his door andwaited for his little calf and when the cowherd drove the cows throughthe village and the calf was missing he inquired where it was', 'Thecowherd answered It is still standing out there eating', 'It would notstop and come with us', 'But the little peasant said Oh but I musthave my beast back again', 'Then they went back to the meadow togetherbut someone had stolen the calf and it was gone', 'The cowherd said Itmust have run away', 'The peasant however said Dont tell methat and led the cowherd before the mayor who for his carelessnesscondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they hadso long wished and they were heartily glad but they had no food forit and could give it nothing to eat so it soon had to be killed', 'Theysalted the flesh and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sellthe skin there so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds', 'Onthe way he passed by a mill and there sat a raven with broken wingsand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin', 'But as theweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind he couldgo no farther and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter', 'Themillers wife was alone in the house and said to the peasant Layyourself on the straw there and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.The peasant ate it and lay down with his skin beside him and the womanthought He is tired and has gone to sleep', 'In the meantime came theparson the millers wife received him well and said My husband isout so we will have a feast', 'The peasant listened and when he heardthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to makeshift with a slice of bread and cheese', 'Then the woman served up fourdifferent things roast meat salad cakes and wine.Just as they were about to sit down and eat there was a knockingoutside', 'The woman said Oh heavens It is my husband she quicklyhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove the wine under the pillowthe salad on the bed the cakes under it and the parson in the closeton the porch', 'Then she opened the door for her husband and said Thankheaven you are back again There is such a storm it looks as if theworld were coming to an end', 'The miller saw the peasant lying on thestraw and asked What is that fellow doing there Ah said thewife the poor knave came in the storm and rain and begged forshelter so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese and showed him wherethe straw was', 'The man said I have no objection but be quick and getme something to eat', 'The woman said But I have nothing but bread andcheese', 'I am contented with anything replied the husband so far asI am concerned bread and cheese will do and looked at the peasant andsaid Come and eat some more with me', 'The peasant did not require tobe invited twice but got up and ate', 'After this the miller saw the skinin which the raven was lying on the ground and asked What have youthere The peasant answered I have a soothsayer inside it', 'Canhe foretell anything to me said the miller', 'Why not answeredthe peasant but he only says four things and the fifth he keeps tohimself', 'The miller was curious and said Let him foretell somethingfor once', 'Then the peasant pinched the ravens head so that he croakedand made a noise like krr krr', 'The miller said What did he say Thepeasant answered In the first place he says that there is some winehidden under the pillow', 'Bless me cried the miller and went thereand found the wine', 'Now go on said he', 'The peasant made the ravencroak again and said In the second place he says that there is someroast meat in the tiled stove', 'Upon my word cried the miller andwent thither and found the roast meat', 'The peasant made the ravenprophesy still more and said Thirdly he says that there is somesalad on the bed', 'That would be a fine thing cried the miller andwent there and found the salad', 'At last the peasant pinched the ravenonce more till he croaked and said Fourthly he says that thereare some cakes under the bed', 'That would be a fine thing cried themiller and looked there and found the cakes.And now the two sat down to the table together but the millers wifewas frightened to death and went to bed and took all the keys withher', 'The miller would have liked much to know the fifth but the littlepeasant said First we will quickly eat the four things for the fifthis something bad', 'So they ate and after that they bargained how muchthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy until they agreed onthree hundred talers', 'Then the peasant once more pinched the ravenshead till he croaked loudly', 'The miller asked What did he say Thepeasant replied He says that the Devil is hiding outside there inthe closet on the porch', 'The miller said The Devil must go out andopened the housedoor then the woman was forced to give up the keysand the peasant unlocked the closet', 'The parson ran out as fast as hecould and the miller said It was true I saw the black rascal with myown eyes', 'The peasant however made off next morning by daybreak withthe three hundred talers.At home the small peasant gradually launched out he built a beautifulhouse and the peasants said The small peasant has certainly been tothe place where golden snow falls and people carry the gold home inshovels', 'Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor andbidden to say from whence his wealth came', 'He answered I sold my cowsskin in the town for three hundred talers', 'When the peasants heardthat they too wished to enjoy this great profit and ran home killedall their cows and stripped off their skins in order to sell them inthe town to the greatest advantage', 'The mayor however said But myservant must go first', 'When she came to the merchant in the town hedid not give her more than two talers for a skin and when the otherscame he did not give them so much and said What can I do with allthese skinsThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thusoutwitted them wanted to take vengeance on him and accused him of thistreachery before the mayor', 'The innocent little peasant was unanimouslysentenced to death and was to be rolled into the water in a barrelpierced full of holes', 'He was led forth and a priest was brought whowas to say a mass for his soul', 'The others were all obliged to retire toa distance and when the peasant looked at the priest he recognized theman who had been with the millers wife', 'He said to him I set you freefrom the closet set me free from the barrel', 'At this same moment upcame with a flock of sheep the very shepherd whom the peasant knew hadlong been wishing to be mayor so he cried with all his might No Iwill not do it if the whole world insists on it I will not do it Theshepherd hearing that came up to him and asked What are you aboutWhat is it that you will not do The peasant said They want to makeme mayor if I will but put myself in the barrel but I will not do it.The shepherd said If nothing more than that is needful in order to bemayor I would get into the barrel at once', 'The peasant said If youwill get in you will be mayor', 'The shepherd was willing and got inand the peasant shut the top down on him then he took the shepherdsflock for himself and drove it away', 'The parson went to the crowdand declared that the mass had been said', 'Then they came and rolled thebarrel towards the water', 'When the barrel began to roll the shepherdcried I am quite willing to be mayor', 'They believed no otherwise thanthat it was the peasant who was saying this and answered That iswhat we intend but first you shall look about you a little down belowthere and they rolled the barrel down into the water.After that the peasants went home and as they were entering thevillage the small peasant also came quietly in driving a flock ofsheep and looking quite contented', 'Then the peasants were astonishedand said Peasant from whence do you come Have you come out of thewater Yes truly replied the peasant I sank deep deep downuntil at last I got to the bottom I pushed the bottom out of thebarrel and crept out and there were pretty meadows on which a numberof lambs were feeding and from thence I brought this flock away withme', 'Said the peasants Are there any more there Oh yes said hemore than I could want', 'Then the peasants made up their minds thatthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves a flock apiece but themayor said I come first', 'So they went to the water together and justthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky whichare called little lambs and they were reflected in the water whereuponthe peasants cried We already see the sheep down below The mayorpressed forward and said I will go down first and look about me andif things promise well Ill call you', 'So he jumped in splash wentthe water it sounded as if he were calling them and the whole crowdplunged in after him as one man', 'Then the entire village was dead andthe small peasant as sole heir became a rich man.FREDERICK AND CATHERINEThere was once a man called Frederick he had a wife whose name wasCatherine and they had not long been married', 'One day Frederick said.Kate I am going to work in the fields when I come back I shall behungry so let me have something nice cooked and a good draught of ale.Very well said she it shall all be ready', 'When dinnertime drewnigh Catherine took a nice steak which was all the meat she had andput it on the fire to fry', 'The steak soon began to look brown and tocrackle in the pan and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned itthen she said to herself The steak is almost ready I may as well goto the cellar for the ale', 'So she left the pan on the fire and took alarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask', 'The beer raninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on', 'At last it popped into herhead The dog is not shut uphe may be running away with the steakthats well thought of', 'So up she ran from the cellar and sure enoughthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth and was making off withit.Away ran Catherine and away ran the dog across the field but he ranfaster than she and stuck close to the steak', 'Its all gone and whatcant be cured must be endured said Catherine', 'So she turned roundand as she had run a good way and was tired she walked home leisurelyto cool herself.Now all this time the ale was running too for Catherine had not turnedthe cock and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor tillthe cask was empty', 'When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what hadhappened', 'My stars said she what shall I do to keep Frederick fromseeing all this slopping about So she thought a while and at lastremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fairand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the alenicely', 'What a lucky thing said she that we kept that meal we havenow a good use for it', 'So away she went for it but she managed to setit down just upon the great jug full of beer and upset it and thusall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also', 'Ahwell said she when one goes another may as well follow', 'Then shestrewed the meal all about the cellar and was quite pleased with hercleverness and said How very neat and clean it looksAt noon Frederick came home', 'Now wife cried he what have you fordinner O Frederick answered she I was cooking you a steak butwhile I went down to draw the ale the dog ran away with it and whileI ran after him the ale ran out and when I went to dry up the alewith the sack of meal that we got at the fair I upset the jug but thecellar is now quite dry and looks so clean Kate Kate said hehow could you do all this Why did you leave the steak to fry and theale to run and then spoil all the meal Why Frederick said she Idid not know I was doing wrong you should have told me before.The husband thought to himself If my wife manages matters thus I mustlook sharp myself', 'Now he had a good deal of gold in the house so hesaid to Catherine What pretty yellow buttons these are I shall putthem into a box and bury them in the garden but take care that younever go near or meddle with them', 'No Frederick said she thatI never will', 'As soon as he was gone there came by some pedlars withearthenware plates and dishes and they asked her whether she would buy.Oh dear me I should like to buy very much but I have no money ifyou had any use for yellow buttons I might deal with you', 'Yellowbuttons said they let us have a look at them', 'Go into the gardenand dig where I tell you and you will find the yellow buttons I darenot go myself', 'So the rogues went and when they found what theseyellow buttons were they took them all away and left her plenty ofplates and dishes', 'Then she set them all about the house for a showand when Frederick came back he cried out Kate what have you beendoing See said she I have bought all these with your yellowbuttons but I did not touch them myself the pedlars went themselvesand dug them up', 'Wife wife said Frederick what a pretty piece ofwork you have made those yellow buttons were all my money how came youto do such a thing Why answered she I did not know there was anyharm in it you should have told me.Catherine stood musing for a while and at last said to her husbandHark ye Frederick we will soon get the gold back let us run afterthe thieves', 'Well we will try answered he but take some butterand cheese with you that we may have something to eat by the way.Very well said she and they set out and as Frederick walked thefastest he left his wife some way behind', 'It does not matter thoughtshe when we turn back I shall be so much nearer home than he.Presently she came to the top of a hill down the side of which therewas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the treeson each side as they passed', 'Ah see now said she how they havebruised and wounded those poor trees they will never get well', 'So shetook pity on them and made use of the butter to grease them all sothat the wheels might not hurt them so much', 'While she was doing thiskind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket and rolled downthe hill', 'Catherine looked but could not see where it had gone so shesaid Well I suppose the other will go the same way and find you hehas younger legs than I have', 'Then she rolled the other cheese afterit and away it went nobody knows where down the hill', 'But she saidshe supposed that they knew the road and would follow her and shecould not stay there all day waiting for them.At last she overtook Frederick who desired her to give him something toeat', 'Then she gave him the dry bread', 'Where are the butter and cheesesaid he', 'Oh answered she I used the butter to grease those poortrees that the wheels chafed so and one of the cheeses ran away so Isent the other after it to find it and I suppose they are both onthe road together somewhere', 'What a goose you are to do such sillythings said the husband', 'How can you say so said she I am sureyou never told me not.They ate the dry bread together and Frederick said Kate I hope youlocked the door safe when you came away', 'No answered she you didnot tell me', 'Then go home and do it now before we go any farthersaid Frederick and bring with you something to eat.Catherine did as he told her and thought to herself by the wayFrederick wants something to eat but I dont think he is very fond ofbutter and cheese Ill bring him a bag of fine nuts and the vinegarfor I have often seen him take some.When she reached home she bolted the back door but the front door shetook off the hinges and said Frederick told me to lock the door butsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me', 'So she tookher time by the way and when she overtook her husband she criedout There Frederick there is the door itself you may watch it ascarefully as you please', 'Alas alas said he what a clever wife Ihave I sent you to make the house fast and you take the door away sothat everybody may go in and out as they pleasehowever as you havebrought the door you shall carry it about with you for your pains.Very well answered she Ill carry the door but Ill not carry thenuts and vinegar bottle alsothat would be too much of a load so ifyou please Ill fasten them to the door.Frederick of course made no objection to that plan and they set offinto the wood to look for the thieves but they could not find them andwhen it grew dark they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.Scarcely were they up than who should come by but the very rogues theywere looking for', 'They were in truth great rascals and belonged to thatclass of people who find things before they are lost they were tiredso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick andCatherine were', 'Frederick slipped down on the other side and picked upsome stones', 'Then he climbed up again and tried to hit the thieves onthe head with them but they only said It must be near morning forthe wind shakes the firapples down.Catherine who had the door on her shoulder began to be very tiredbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy so she saidsoftly Frederick I must let the nuts go', 'No answered he notnow they will discover us', 'I cant help that they must go', 'Wellthen make haste and throw them down if you will', 'Then away rattledthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried Bless meit is hailing.A little while after Catherine thought the door was still very heavyso she whispered to Frederick I must throw the vinegar down', 'Praydont answered he it will discover us', 'I cant help that saidshe go it must', 'So she poured all the vinegar down and the thievessaid What a heavy dew there isAt last it popped into Catherines head that it was the door itself thatwas so heavy all the time so she whispered Frederick I must throwthe door down soon', 'But he begged and prayed her not to do so for hewas sure it would betray them', 'Here goes however said she and downwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves that they criedout Murder and not knowing what was coming ran away as fast as theycould and left all the gold', 'So when Frederick and Catherine came downthere they found all their money safe and sound.SWEETHEART ROLANDThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had twodaughters one ugly and wicked and this one she loved because she washer own daughter and one beautiful and good and this one she hatedbecause she was her stepdaughter', 'The stepdaughter once had a prettyapron which the other fancied so much that she became envious andtold her mother that she must and would have that apron', 'Be quiet mychild said the old woman and you shall have it', 'Your stepsister haslong deserved death tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut herhead off', 'Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed andpush her well to the front', 'It would have been all over with the poorgirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner and heardeverything', 'All day long she dared not go out of doors and when bedtimehad come the witchs daughter got into bed first so as to lie at thefar side but when she was asleep the other pushed her gently to thefront and took for herself the place at the back close by the wall', 'Inthe night the old woman came creeping in she held an axe in her righthand and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outsideand then she grasped the axe with both hands and cut her own childshead off.When she had gone away the girl got up and went to her sweetheart whowas called Roland and knocked at his door', 'When he came out she saidto him Listen dearest Roland we must fly in all haste my stepmotherwanted to kill me but has struck her own child', 'When daylight comesand she sees what she has done we shall be lost', 'But said RolandI counsel you first to take away her magic wand or we cannot escapeif she pursues us', 'The maiden fetched the magic wand and she took thedead girls head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground one infront of the bed one in the kitchen and one on the stairs', 'Then shehurried away with her lover.When the old witch got up next morning she called her daughter andwanted to give her the apron but she did not come', 'Then the witchcried Where are you Here on the stairs I am sweeping answeredthe first drop of blood', 'The old woman went out but saw no one on thestairs and cried again Where are you Here in the kitchen I amwarming myself cried the second drop of blood', 'She went into thekitchen but found no one', 'Then she cried again Where are you Ahhere in the bed I am sleeping cried the third drop of blood', 'She wentinto the room to the bed', 'What did she see there Her own childwhose head she had cut off bathed in her blood', 'The witch fell intoa passion sprang to the window and as she could look forth quite farinto the world she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with hersweetheart Roland', 'That shall not help you cried she even if youhave got a long way off you shall still not escape me', 'She put on hermanyleague boots in which she covered an hours walk at every stepand it was not long before she overtook them', 'The girl however whenshe saw the old woman striding towards her changed with her magicwand her sweetheart Roland into a lake and herself into a duckswimming in the middle of it', 'The witch placed herself on the shorethrew breadcrumbs in and went to endless trouble to entice the duckbut the duck did not let herself be enticed and the old woman had togo home at night as she had come', 'At this the girl and her sweetheartRoland resumed their natural shapes again and they walked on the wholenight until daybreak', 'Then the maiden changed herself into a beautifulflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge and her sweetheartRoland into a fiddler', 'It was not long before the witch came striding uptowards them and said to the musician Dear musician may I pluck thatbeautiful flower for myself Oh yes he replied I will play toyou while you do it', 'As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and wasjust going to pluck the flower knowing perfectly well who the flowerwas he began to play and whether she would or not she was forcedto dance for it was a magical dance', 'The faster he played the moreviolent springs was she forced to make and the thorns tore her clothesfrom her body and pricked her and wounded her till she bled and as hedid not stop she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.As they were now set free Roland said Now I will go to my father andarrange for the wedding', 'Then in the meantime I will stay here andwait for you said the girl and that no one may recognize me I willchange myself into a red stone landmark', 'Then Roland went away and thegirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.But when Roland got home he fell into the snares of another who sofascinated him that he forgot the maiden', 'The poor girl remained there along time but at length as he did not return at all she was sad andchanged herself into a flower and thought Someone will surely comethis way and trample me down.It befell however that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and sawthe flower and as it was so pretty plucked it took it with him andlaid it away in his chest', 'From that time forth strange things happenedin the shepherds house', 'When he arose in the morning all the work wasalready done the room was swept the table and benches cleaned thefire in the hearth was lighted and the water was fetched and at noonwhen he came home the table was laid and a good dinner served', 'Hecould not conceive how this came to pass for he never saw a human beingin his house and no one could have concealed himself in it', 'He wascertainly pleased with this good attendance but still at last he was soafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice', 'The wisewoman said There is some enchantment behind it listen very early somemorning if anything is moving in the room and if you see anything nomatter what it is throw a white cloth over it and then the magic willbe stopped.The shepherd did as she bade him and next morning just as day dawnedhe saw the chest open and the flower come out', 'Swiftly hesprang towards it and threw a white cloth over it', 'Instantly thetransformation came to an end and a beautiful girl stood before himwho admitted to him that she had been the flower and that up to thistime she had attended to his housekeeping', 'She told him her storyand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him but sheanswered No for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheartRoland although he had deserted her', 'Nevertheless she promised not togo away but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.And now the time drew near when Rolands wedding was to be celebratedand then according to an old custom in the country it was announcedthat all the girls were to be present at it and sing in honour of thebridal pair', 'When the faithful maiden heard of this she grew so sadthat she thought her heart would break and she would not go thitherbut the other girls came and took her', 'When it came to her turn to singshe stepped back until at last she was the only one left and then shecould not refuse', 'But when she began her song and it reached Rolandsears he sprang up and cried I know the voice that is the truebride I will have no other Everything he had forgotten and which hadvanished from his mind had suddenly come home again to his heart', 'Thenthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland andgrief came to an end and joy began.SNOWDROPIt was the middle of winter when the broad flakes of snow were fallingaround that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat workingat her window', 'The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony andas she sat looking out upon the snow she pricked her finger and threedrops of blood fell upon it', 'Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the reddrops that sprinkled the white snow and said Would that my littledaughter may be as white as that snow as red as that blood and asblack as this ebony windowframe And so the little girl really did growup her skin was as white as snow her cheeks as rosy as the blood andher hair as black as ebony and she was called Snowdrop.But this queen died and the king soon married another wife who becamequeen and was very beautiful but so vain that she could not bearto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was', 'She had a fairylookingglass to which she used to go and then she would gaze uponherself in it and say Tell me glass tell me true  Of all the ladies in the land  Who is fairest tell me whoAnd the glass had always answered Thou queen art the fairest in all the land.But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful and when she was seven yearsold she was as bright as the day and fairer than the queen herself.Then the glass one day answered the queen when she went to look in itas usual Thou queen art fair and beauteous to see  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than theeWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy and called toone of her servants and said Take Snowdrop away into the wide woodthat I may never see her any more', 'Then the servant led her away buthis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life and hesaid I will not hurt you thou pretty child', 'So he left her byherself and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts wouldtear her in pieces he felt as if a great weight were taken off hisheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her toher fate with the chance of someone finding and saving her.Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear andthe wild beasts roared about her but none did her any harm', 'In theevening she came to a cottage among the hills and went in to rest forher little feet would carry her no further', 'Everything was spruce andneat in the cottage on the table was spread a white cloth and therewere seven little plates seven little loaves and seven little glasseswith wine in them and seven knives and forks laid in order and bythe wall stood seven little beds', 'As she was very hungry she pickeda little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of eachglass and after that she thought she would lie down and rest', 'So shetried all the little beds but one was too long and another was tooshort till at last the seventh suited her and there she laid herselfdown and went to sleep.By and by in came the masters of the cottage', 'Now they were seven littledwarfs that lived among the mountains and dug and searched for gold.They lighted up their seven lamps and saw at once that all was notright', 'The first said Who has been sitting on my stool The secondWho has been eating off my plate The third Who has been picking mybread The fourth Who has been meddling with my spoon The fifthWho has been handling my fork The sixth Who has been cutting withmy knife The seventh Who has been drinking my wine Then the firstlooked round and said Who has been lying on my bed And the rest camerunning to him and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon hisbed', 'But the seventh saw Snowdrop and called all his brethren to comeand see her and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and broughttheir lamps to look at her and said Good heavens what a lovely childshe is And they were very glad to see her and took care not to wakeher and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfsin turn till the night was gone.In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story and they pitied herand said if she would keep all things in order and cook and wash andknit and spin for them she might stay where she was and they wouldtake good care of her', 'Then they went out all day long to their workseeking for gold and silver in the mountains but Snowdrop was left athome and they warned her and said The queen will soon find out whereyou are so take care and let no one in.But the queen now that she thought Snowdrop was dead believed that shemust be the handsomest lady in the land and she went to her glass andsaid Tell me glass tell me true  Of all the ladies in the land  Who is fairest tell me whoAnd the glass answered Thou queen art the fairest in all this land  But over the hills in the greenwood shade  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made  There Snowdrop is hiding her head and she  Is lovelier far O queen than thee.Then the queen was very much frightened for she knew that the glassalways spoke the truth and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautifulthan she was so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar and wenther way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt', 'Then sheknocked at the door and cried Fine wares to sell Snowdrop lookedout at the window and said Good day good woman what have you tosell Good wares fine wares said she laces and bobbins of allcolours', 'I will let the old lady in she seems to be a very goodsort of body thought Snowdrop as she ran down and unbolted the door.Bless me said the old woman how badly your stays are laced Let melace them up with one of my nice new laces', 'Snowdrop did not dream ofany mischief so she stood before the old woman but she set to workso nimbly and pulled the lace so tight that Snowdrops breath wasstopped and she fell down as if she were dead', 'Theres an end to allthy beauty said the spiteful queen and went away home.In the evening the seven dwarfs came home and I need not say howgrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon theground as if she was quite dead', 'However they lifted her up and whenthey found what ailed her they cut the lace and in a little time shebegan to breathe and very soon came to life again', 'Then they said Theold woman was the queen herself take care another time and let no onein when we are away.When the queen got home she went straight to her glass and spoke to itas before but to her great grief it still said Thou queen art the fairest in all this land  But over the hills in the greenwood shade  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made  There Snowdrop is hiding her head and she  Is lovelier far O queen than thee.Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to see thatSnowdrop still lived and she dressed herself up again but in quiteanother dress from the one she wore before and took with her a poisonedcomb', 'When she reached the dwarfs cottage she knocked at the door andcried Fine wares to sell But Snowdrop said I dare not let anyonein', 'Then the queen said Only look at my beautiful combs and gaveher the poisoned one', 'And it looked so pretty that she took it up andput it into her hair to try it but the moment it touched her headthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless', 'There you maylie said the queen and went her way', 'But by good luck the dwarfscame in very early that evening and when they saw Snowdrop lying onthe ground they thought what had happened and soon found the poisonedcomb', 'And when they took it away she got well and told them all thathad passed and they warned her once more not to open the door toanyone.Meantime the queen went home to her glass and shook with rage when sheread the very same answer as before and she said Snowdrop shall dieif it cost me my life', 'So she went by herself into her chamber and gotready a poisoned apple the outside looked very rosy and tempting butwhoever tasted it was sure to die', 'Then she dressed herself up as apeasants wife and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs cottageand knocked at the door but Snowdrop put her head out of the window andsaid I dare not let anyone in for the dwarfs have told me not', 'Doas you please said the old woman but at any rate take this prettyapple I will give it you', 'No said Snowdrop I dare not take it.You silly girl answered the other what are you afraid of Do youthink it is poisoned Come do you eat one part and I will eat theother', 'Now the apple was so made up that one side was good though theother side was poisoned', 'Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste forthe apple looked so very nice and when she saw the old woman eat shecould wait no longer', 'But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouthwhen she fell down dead upon the ground', 'This time nothing will savethee said the queen and she went home to her glass and at last itsaid Thou queen art the fairest of all the fair.And then her wicked heart was glad and as happy as such a heart couldbe.When evening came and the dwarfs had gone home they found Snowdroplying on the ground no breath came from her lips and they were afraidthat she was quite dead', 'They lifted her up and combed her hair andwashed her face with wine and water but all was in vain for the littlegirl seemed quite dead', 'So they laid her down upon a bier and all sevenwatched and bewailed her three whole days and then they thought theywould bury her but her cheeks were still rosy and her face looked justas it did while she was alive so they said We will never bury her inthe cold ground', 'And they made a coffin of glass so that they mightstill look at her and wrote upon it in golden letters what her namewas and that she was a kings daughter', 'And the coffin was set amongthe hills and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched', 'And thebirds of the air came too and bemoaned Snowdrop and first of all camean owl and then a raven and at last a dove and sat by her side.And thus Snowdrop lay for a long long time and still only looked asthough she was asleep for she was even now as white as snow and as redas blood and as black as ebony', 'At last a prince came and called at thedwarfs house and he saw Snowdrop and read what was written in goldenletters', 'Then he offered the dwarfs money and prayed and besought themto let him take her away but they said We will not part with her forall the gold in the world', 'At last however they had pity on him andgave him the coffin but the moment he lifted it up to carry it homewith him the piece of apple fell from between her lips and Snowdropawoke and said Where am I And the prince said Thou art quite safewith me.Then he told her all that had happened and said I love you far betterthan all the world so come with me to my fathers palace and you shallbe my wife', 'And Snowdrop consented and went home with the princeand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for theirwedding.To the feast was asked among the rest Snowdrops old enemy the queenand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes she looked in theglass and said Tell me glass tell me true  Of all the ladies in the land  Who is fairest tell me whoAnd the glass answered Thou lady art loveliest here I ween  But lovelier far is the newmade queen.When she heard this she started with rage but her envy and curiositywere so great that she could not help setting out to see the bride', 'Andwhen she got there and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop who asshe thought had been dead a long while she choked with rage and felldown and died but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happilyover that land many many years and sometimes they went up into themountains and paid a visit to the little dwarfs who had been so kindto Snowdrop in her time of need.THE PINKThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven tobestow on her a son or a daughter', 'Then an angel from heaven came to herand said Be at rest you shall have a son with the power of wishingso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for that shall he have', 'Thenshe went to the king and told him the joyful tidings and when the timewas come she gave birth to a son and the king was filled with gladness.Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wildbeasts were kept and washed herself there in a clear stream', 'Ithappened once when the child was a little older that it was lying inher arms and she fell asleep', 'Then came the old cook who knew that thechild had the power of wishing and stole it away and he took a henand cut it in pieces and dropped some of its blood on the queens apronand on her dress', 'Then he carried the child away to a secret placewhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it and he ran to the king andaccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her bythe wild beasts', 'When the king saw the blood on her apron he believedthis fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be builtin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put intoit and walled up', 'Here she was to stay for seven years without meator drink and die of hunger', 'But God sent two angels from heaven in theshape of white doves which flew to her twice a day and carried herfood until the seven years were over.The cook however thought to himself If the child has the power ofwishing and I am here he might very easily get me into trouble', 'Sohe left the palace and went to the boy who was already big enough tospeak and said to him Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself witha garden and all else that pertains to it', 'Scarcely were the words outof the boys mouth when everything was there that he had wished for.After a while the cook said to him It is not well for you to be soalone wish for a pretty girl as a companion', 'Then the kings sonwished for one and she immediately stood before him and was morebeautiful than any painter could have painted her', 'The two playedtogether and loved each other with all their hearts and the old cookwent out hunting like a nobleman', 'The thought occurred to him howeverthat the kings son might some day wish to be with his father and thusbring him into great peril', 'So he went out and took the maiden asideand said Tonight when the boy is asleep go to his bed and plunge thisknife into his heart and bring me his heart and tongue and if you donot do it you shall lose your life', 'Thereupon he went away and whenhe returned next day she had not done it and said Why should I shedthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone The cook oncemore said If you do not do it it shall cost you your own life', 'Whenhe had gone away she had a little hind brought to her and ordered herto be killed and took her heart and tongue and laid them on a plateand when she saw the old man coming she said to the boy Lie down inyour bed and draw the clothes over you', 'Then the wicked wretch came inand said Where are the boys heart and tongue The girl reached theplate to him but the kings son threw off the quilt and said You oldsinner why did you want to kill me Now will I pronounce thy sentence.You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neckand shall eat burning coals till the flames burst forth from yourthroat', 'And when he had spoken these words the old man was changedinto a poodle dog and had a gold collar round his neck and the cookswere ordered to bring up some live coals and these he ate until theflames broke forth from his throat', 'The kings son remained there ashort while longer and he thought of his mother and wondered if shewere still alive', 'At length he said to the maiden I will go home to myown country if you will go with me I will provide for you', 'Ahshe replied the way is so long and what shall I do in a strange landwhere I am unknown As she did not seem quite willing and as theycould not be parted from each other he wished that she might be changedinto a beautiful pink and took her with him', 'Then he went away to hisown country and the poodle had to run after him', 'He went to the towerin which his mother was confined and as it was so high he wished fora ladder which would reach up to the very top', 'Then he mounted up andlooked inside and cried Beloved mother Lady Queen are you stillalive or are you dead She answered I have just eaten and am stillsatisfied for she thought the angels were there', 'Said he I am yourdear son whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your armsbut I am alive still and will soon set you free', 'Then he descendedagain and went to his father and caused himself to be announced as astrange huntsman and asked if he could offer him service', 'The king saidyes if he was skilful and could get game for him he should come tohim but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of thedistrict or country', 'Then the huntsman promised to procure as much gamefor him as he could possibly use at the royal table', 'So he summoned allthe huntsmen together and bade them go out into the forest with him.And he went with them and made them form a great circle open at one endwhere he stationed himself and began to wish', 'Two hundred deer and morecame running inside the circle at once and the huntsmen shot them.Then they were all placed on sixty country carts and driven home to theking and for once he was able to deck his table with game after havinghad none at all for years.Now the king felt great joy at this and commanded that his entirehousehold should eat with him next day and made a great feast', 'Whenthey were all assembled together he said to the huntsman As you areso clever you shall sit by me', 'He replied Lord King your majestymust excuse me I am a poor huntsman', 'But the king insisted on itand said You shall sit by me until he did it', 'Whilst he was sittingthere he thought of his dearest mother and wished that one of thekings principal servants would begin to speak of her and would ask howit was faring with the queen in the tower and if she were alive stillor had perished', 'Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal beganand said Your majesty we live joyously here but how is the queenliving in the tower Is she still alive or has she died But the kingreplied She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts I willnot have her named', 'Then the huntsman arose and said Gracious lordfather she is alive still and I am her son and I was not carried awayby wild beasts but by that wretch the old cook who tore me from herarms when she was asleep and sprinkled her apron with the blood of achicken', 'Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar and saidThat is the wretch and caused live coals to be brought and these thedog was compelled to devour before the sight of all until flames burstforth from its throat', 'On this the huntsman asked the king if he wouldlike to see the dog in his true shape and wished him back into the formof the cook in which he stood immediately with his white apronand his knife by his side', 'When the king saw him he fell into a passionand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon', 'Then the huntsmanspoke further and said Father will you see the maiden who brought meup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me but did not do itthough her own life depended on it The king replied Yes I wouldlike to see her', 'The son said Most gracious father I will show herto you in the form of a beautiful flower and he thrust his hand intohis pocket and brought forth the pink and placed it on the royal tableand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.Then the son said Now will I show her to you in her own form andwished that she might become a maiden and she stood there looking sobeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.And the king sent two waitingmaids and two attendants into the towerto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table', 'But when she wasled in she ate nothing and said The gracious and merciful God who hassupported me in the tower will soon set me free', 'She lived three daysmore and then died happily and when she was buried the two whitedoves which had brought her food to the tower and were angels ofheaven followed her body and seated themselves on her grave', 'The agedking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces but grief consumed thekings own heart and he soon died', 'His son married the beautiful maidenwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket and whether theyare still alive or not is known to God.CLEVER ELSIEThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie', 'Andwhen she had grown up her father said We will get her married', 'Yessaid the mother if only someone would come who would have her', 'Atlength a man came from a distance and wooed her who was called Hansbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart', 'Oh saidthe father she has plenty of good sense and the mother said Ohshe can see the wind coming up the street and hear the flies coughing.Well said Hans if she is not really smart I wont have her', 'Whenthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten the mother said Elsie gointo the cellar and fetch some beer', 'Then Clever Elsie took the pitcherfrom the wall went into the cellar and tapped the lid briskly as shewent so that the time might not appear long', 'When she was below shefetched herself a chair and set it before the barrel so that she hadno need to stoop and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpectedinjury', 'Then she placed the can before her and turned the tap andwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle butlooked up at the wall and after much peering here and there saw apickaxe exactly above her which the masons had accidentally leftthere.Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said If I get Hans and we havea child and he grows big and we send him into the cellar here to drawbeer then the pickaxe will fall on his head and kill him', 'Then shesat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body over themisfortune which lay before her', 'Those upstairs waited for the drinkbut Clever Elsie still did not come', 'Then the woman said to the servantJust go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is', 'The maid went andfound her sitting in front of the barrel screaming loudly', 'Elsie whydo you weep asked the maid', 'Ah she answered have I not reason toweep If I get Hans and we have a child and he grows big and has todraw beer here the pickaxe will perhaps fall on his head and killhim', 'Then said the maid What a clever Elsie we have and sat downbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune', 'After a whileas the maid did not come back and those upstairs were thirsty for thebeer the man said to the boy Just go down into the cellar and seewhere Elsie and the girl are', 'The boy went down and there sat CleverElsie and the girl both weeping together', 'Then he asked Why are youweeping Ah said Elsie have I not reason to weep If I get Hansand we have a child and he grows big and has to draw beer here thepickaxe will fall on his head and kill him', 'Then said the boy Whata clever Elsie we have and sat down by her and likewise began tohowl loudly', 'Upstairs they waited for the boy but as he still did notreturn the man said to the woman Just go down into the cellar and seewhere Elsie is The woman went down and found all three in the midstof their lamentations and inquired what was the cause then Elsie toldher also that her future child was to be killed by the pickaxe when itgrew big and had to draw beer and the pickaxe fell down', 'Then said themother likewise What a clever Elsie we have and sat down and weptwith them', 'The man upstairs waited a short time but as his wife did notcome back and his thirst grew ever greater he said I must go into thecellar myself and see where Elsie is', 'But when he got into the cellarand they were all sitting together crying and he heard the reason andthat Elsies child was the cause and the Elsie might perhaps bring oneinto the world some day and that he might be killed by the pickaxe ifhe should happen to be sitting beneath it drawing beer just at the verytime when it fell down he cried Oh what a clever Elsie and satdown and likewise wept with them', 'The bridegroom stayed upstairs alonefor a long time then as no one would come back he thought They must bewaiting for me below I too must go there and see what they are about.When he got down the five of them were sitting screaming and lamentingquite piteously each outdoing the other', 'What misfortune has happenedthen asked he', 'Ah dear Hans said Elsie if we marry each otherand have a child and he is big and we perhaps send him here to drawsomething to drink then the pickaxe which has been left up there mightdash his brains out if it were to fall down so have we not reason toweep Come said Hans more understanding than that is not neededfor my household as you are such a clever Elsie I will have you andseized her hand took her upstairs with him and married her.After Hans had had her some time he said Wife I am going out to workand earn some money for us go into the field and cut the corn that wemay have some bread', 'Yes dear Hans I will do that', 'After Hans hadgone away she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the fieldwith her', 'When she came to the field she said to herself What shall Ido shall I cut first or shall I eat first Oh I will eat first', 'Thenshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied she oncemore said What shall I do Shall I cut first or shall I sleep firstI will sleep first', 'Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.Hans had been at home for a long time but Elsie did not come then saidhe What a clever Elsie I have she is so industrious that she does noteven come home to eat', 'But when evening came and she still stayed awayHans went out to see what she had cut but nothing was cut and shewas lying among the corn asleep', 'Then Hans hastened home and broughta fowlers net with little bells and hung it round about her and shestill went on sleeping', 'Then he ran home shut the housedoor and satdown in his chair and worked', 'At length when it was quite dark CleverElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round abouther and the bells rang at each step which she took', 'Then she wasalarmed and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie ornot and said Is it I or is it not I But she knew not what answerto make to this and stood for a time in doubt at length she thoughtI will go home and ask if it be I or if it be not I they will be sureto know', 'She ran to the door of her own house but it was shut thenshe knocked at the window and cried Hans is Elsie within Yesanswered Hans she is within', 'Hereupon she was terrified and saidAh heavens Then it is not I and went to another door but when thepeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it and shecould get in nowhere', 'Then she ran out of the village and no one hasseen her since.THE MISER IN THE BUSHA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant who had worked hard forhim three years without having been paid any wages', 'At last it cameinto the mans head that he would not go on thus without pay any longerso he went to his master and said I have worked hard for you a longtime I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for mytrouble', 'The farmer was a sad miser and knew that his man was verysimplehearted so he took out threepence and gave him for every yearsservice a penny', 'The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money tohave and said to himself Why should I work hard and live here on badfare any longer I can now travel into the wide world and make myselfmerry', 'With that he put his money into his purse and set out roamingover hill and valley.As he jogged along over the fields singing and dancing a little dwarfmet him and asked him what made him so merry', 'Why what should makeme downhearted said he I am sound in health and rich in purse whatshould I care for I have saved up my three years earnings and have itall safe in my pocket', 'How much may it come to said the little man.Full threepence replied the countryman', 'I wish you would give themto me said the other I am very poor', 'Then the man pitied him andgave him all he had and the little dwarf said in return As you havesuch a kind honest heart I will grant you three wishesone for everypenny so choose whatever you like', 'Then the countryman rejoiced athis good luck and said I like many things better than money first Iwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at secondlya fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it andthirdly I should like that everyone should grant what I ask', 'The dwarfsaid he should have his three wishes so he gave him the bow and fiddleand went his way.Our honest friend journeyed on his way too and if he was merry beforehe was now ten times more so', 'He had not gone far before he met an oldmiser close by them stood a tree and on the topmost twig sat a thrushsinging away most joyfully', 'Oh what a pretty bird said the miser Iwould give a great deal of money to have such a one', 'If thats allsaid the countryman I will soon bring it down', 'Then he took up hisbow and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.The miser crept into the bush to find it but directly he had got intothe middle his companion took up his fiddle and played away and themiser began to dance and spring about capering higher and higher inthe air', 'The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hungin rags about him and he himself was all scratched and wounded so thatthe blood ran down', 'Oh for heavens sake cried the miser Mastermaster pray let the fiddle alone', 'What have I done to deserve thisThou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough said the other thouart only meeting thy reward so he played up another tune', 'Then themiser began to beg and promise and offered money for his liberty buthe did not come up to the musicians price for some time and he dancedhim along brisker and brisker and the miser bid higher and higher tillat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purseand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow', 'When the countrymansaw so much money he said I will agree to your proposal', 'So he tookthe purse put up his fiddle and travelled on very pleased with hisbargain.Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush halfnaked and in a piteousplight and began to ponder how he should take his revenge and servehis late companion some trick', 'At last he went to the judge andcomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money and beaten himinto the bargain and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at hisback and a fiddle hung round his neck', 'Then the judge sent out hisofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him and hewas soon caught and brought up to be tried.The miser began to tell his tale and said he had been robbed ofhis money', 'No you gave it me for playing a tune to you', 'said thecountryman but the judge told him that was not likely and cut thematter short by ordering him off to the gallows.So away he was taken but as he stood on the steps he said My LordJudge grant me one last request', 'Anything but thy life replied theother', 'No said he I do not ask my life only to let me play uponmy fiddle for the last time', 'The miser cried out Oh no no forheavens sake dont listen to him dont listen to him But the judgesaid It is only this once he will soon have done', 'The fact was hecould not refuse the request on account of the dwarfs third gift.Then the miser said Bind me fast bind me fast for pitys sake', 'Butthe countryman seized his fiddle and struck up a tune and at the firstnote judge clerks and jailer were in motion all began capering andno one could hold the miser', 'At the second note the hangman let hisprisoner go and danced also and by the time he had played the firstbar of the tune all were dancing togetherjudge court and miser andall the people who had followed to look on', 'At first the thing was merryand pleasant enough but when it had gone on a while and there seemedto be no end of playing or dancing they began to cry out and beg himto leave off but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreatiestill the judge not only gave him his life but promised to return himthe hundred florins.Then he called to the miser and said Tell us now you vagabond whereyou got that gold or I shall play on for your amusement only I stoleit said the miser in the presence of all the people I acknowledgethat I stole it and that you earned it fairly', 'Then the countrymanstopped his fiddle and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.ASHPUTTELThe wife of a rich man fell sick and when she felt that her end drewnigh she called her only daughter to her bedside and said Always bea good girl and I will look down from heaven and watch over you', 'Soonafterwards she shut her eyes and died and was buried in the gardenand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept and was alwaysgood and kind to all about her', 'And the snow fell and spread a beautifulwhite covering over the grave but by the time the spring came and thesun had melted it away again her father had married another wife', 'Thisnew wife had two daughters of her own that she brought home with herthey were fair in face but foul at heart and it was now a sorry timefor the poor little girl', 'What does the goodfornothing want in theparlour said they they who would eat bread should first earn itaway with the kitchenmaid Then they took away her fine clothes andgave her an old grey frock to put on and laughed at her and turned herinto the kitchen.There she was forced to do hard work to rise early before daylight tobring the water to make the fire to cook and to wash', 'Besides thatthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways and laughed at her', 'In theevening when she was tired she had no bed to lie down on but was madeto lie by the hearth among the ashes and as this of course made heralways dusty and dirty they called her Ashputtel.It happened once that the father was going to the fair and asked hiswifes daughters what he should bring them', 'Fine clothes said thefirst Pearls and diamonds cried the second', 'Now child said heto his own daughter what will you have The first twig dearfather that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to comehomewards said she', 'Then he bought for the first two the fine clothesand pearls and diamonds they had asked for and on his way home as herode through a green copse a hazel twig brushed against him and almostpushed off his hat so he broke it off and brought it away and when hegot home he gave it to his daughter', 'Then she took it and went toher mothers grave and planted it there and cried so much that it waswatered with her tears and there it grew and became a fine tree', 'Threetimes every day she went to it and cried and soon a little bird cameand built its nest upon the tree and talked with her and watched overher and brought her whatever she wished for.Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast which was tolast three days and out of those who came to it his son was to choosea bride for himself', 'Ashputtels two sisters were asked to come so theycalled her up and said Now comb our hair brush our shoes and tieour sashes for us for we are going to dance at the kings feast.Then she did as she was told but when all was done she could not helpcrying for she thought to herself she should so have liked to havegone with them to the ball and at last she begged her mother very hardto let her go', 'You Ashputtel said she you who have nothing towear no clothes at all and who cannot even danceyou want to go tothe ball And when she kept on begging she said at last to get rid ofher I will throw this dishful of peas into the ashheap and if intwo hours time you have picked them all out you shall go to the feasttoo.Then she threw the peas down among the ashes but the little maiden ranout at the back door into the garden and cried out Hither hither through the sky  Turtledoves and linnets fly  Blackbird thrush and chaffinch gay  Hither hither haste away  One and all come help me quick  Haste ye haste yepick pick pickThen first came two white doves flying in at the kitchen window nextcame two turtledoves and after them came all the little birds underheaven chirping and fluttering in and they flew down into the ashes.And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work pickpick pick and then the others began to pick pick pick and amongthem all they soon picked out all the good grain and put it into a dishbut left the ashes', 'Long before the end of the hour the work was quitedone and all flew out again at the windows.Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother overjoyed at the thoughtthat now she should go to the ball', 'But the mother said No no youslut you have no clothes and cannot dance you shall not go', 'And whenAshputtel begged very hard to go she said If you can in one hourstime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes you shall gotoo', 'And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her', 'So sheshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the houseand cried out as before Hither hither through the sky  Turtledoves and linnets fly  Blackbird thrush and chaffinch gay  Hither hither haste away  One and all come help me quick  Haste ye haste yepick pick pickThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window next came twoturtledoves and after them came all the little birds under heavenchirping and hopping about', 'And they flew down into the ashes and thelittle doves put their heads down and set to work pick pick pick andthen the others began pick pick pick and they put all the good graininto the dishes and left all the ashes', 'Before half an hours time allwas done and out they flew again', 'And then Ashputtel took the dishes toher mother rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.But her mother said It is all of no use you cannot go you have noclothes and cannot dance and you would only put us to shame and offshe went with her two daughters to the ball.Now when all were gone and nobody left at home Ashputtel wentsorrowfully and sat down under the hazeltree and cried out Shake shake hazeltree  Gold and silver over meThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold andsilver dress for her and slippers of spangled silk and she put themon and followed her sisters to the feast', 'But they did not know herand thought it must be some strange princess she looked so fine andbeautiful in her rich clothes and they never once thought of Ashputteltaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.The kings son soon came up to her and took her by the hand and dancedwith her and no one else and he never left her hand but when anyoneelse came to ask her to dance he said This lady is dancing with me.Thus they danced till a late hour of the night and then she wanted togo home and the kings son said I shall go and take care of you toyour home for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived', 'Butshe slipped away from him unawares and ran off towards home and asthe prince followed her she jumped up into the pigeonhouse and shutthe door', 'Then he waited till her father came home and told him thatthe unknown maiden who had been at the feast had hid herself in thepigeonhouse', 'But when they had broken open the door they found no onewithin and as they came back into the house Ashputtel was lying asshe always did in her dirty frock by the ashes and her dim littlelamp was burning in the chimney', 'For she had run as quickly as she couldthrough the pigeonhouse and on to the hazeltree and had there takenoff her beautiful clothes and put them beneath the tree that the birdmight carry them away and had lain down again amid the ashes in herlittle grey frock.The next day when the feast was again held and her father mother andsisters were gone Ashputtel went to the hazeltree and said Shake shake hazeltree  Gold and silver over meAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one shehad worn the day before', 'And when she came in it to the ball everyonewondered at her beauty but the kings son who was waiting for hertook her by the hand and danced with her and when anyone asked her todance he said as before This lady is dancing with me.When night came she wanted to go home and the kings son followed hereas before that he might see into what house she went but she sprangaway from him all at once into the garden behind her fathers house.In this garden stood a fine large peartree full of ripe fruit andAshputtel not knowing where to hide herself jumped up into it withoutbeing seen', 'Then the kings son lost sight of her and could not findout where she was gone but waited till her father came home and saidto him The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away and Ithink she must have sprung into the peartree', 'The father thought tohimself Can it be Ashputtel So he had an axe brought and they cutdown the tree but found no one upon it', 'And when they came back intothe kitchen there lay Ashputtel among the ashes for she had slippeddown on the other side of the tree and carried her beautiful clothesback to the bird at the hazeltree and then put on her little greyfrock.The third day when her father and mother and sisters were gone shewent again into the garden and said Shake shake hazeltree  Gold and silver over meThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than theformer one and slippers which were all of gold so that when she cameto the feast no one knew what to say for wonder at her beauty and thekings son danced with nobody but her and when anyone else asked her todance he said This lady is my partner sir.When night came she wanted to go home and the kings son would go withher and said to himself I will not lose her this time but howevershe again slipped away from him though in such a hurry that she droppedher left golden slipper upon the stairs.The prince took the shoe and went the next day to the king his fatherand said I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipperfits', 'Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it for theyhad beautiful feet and had no doubt that they could wear the goldenslipper', 'The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was andwanted to try it on and the mother stood by', 'But her great toe couldnot go into it and the shoe was altogether much too small for her', 'Thenthe mother gave her a knife and said Never mind cut it off when youare queen you will not care about toes you will not want to walk', 'Sothe silly girl cut off her great toe and thus squeezed on the shoeand went to the kings son', 'Then he took her for his bride and set herbeside him on his horse and rode away with her homewards.But on their way home they had to pass by the hazeltree that Ashputtelhad planted and on the branch sat a little dove singing Back again back again look to the shoe  The shoe is too small and not made for you  Prince prince look again for thy bride  For shes not the true one that sits by thy side.Then the prince got down and looked at her foot and he saw by theblood that streamed from it what a trick she had played him', 'So heturned his horse round and brought the false bride back to her homeand said This is not the right bride let the other sister try and puton the slipper', 'Then she went into the room and got her foot into theshoe all but the heel which was too large', 'But her mother squeezed itin till the blood came and took her to the kings son and he set heras his bride by his side on his horse and rode away with her.But when they came to the hazeltree the little dove sat there stilland sang Back again back again look to the shoe  The shoe is too small and not made for you  Prince prince look again for thy bride  For shes not the true one that sits by thy side.Then he looked down and saw that the blood streamed so much from theshoe that her white stockings were quite red', 'So he turned his horseand brought her also back again', 'This is not the true bride said heto the father have you no other daughters No said he there isonly a little dirty Ashputtel here the child of my first wife I amsure she cannot be the bride', 'The prince told him to send her', 'But themother said No no she is much too dirty she will not dare to showherself', 'However the prince would have her come and she first washedher face and hands and then went in and curtsied to him and he reachedher the golden slipper', 'Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left footand put on the golden slipper and it fitted her as if it had been madefor her', 'And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her andsaid This is the right bride', 'But the mother and both the sisterswere frightened and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on hishorse and rode away with her', 'And when they came to the hazeltree thewhite dove sang Home home look at the shoe  Princess the shoe was made for you  Prince prince take home thy bride  For she is the true one that sits by thy sideAnd when the dove had done its song it came flying and perched uponher right shoulder and so went home with her.THE WHITE SNAKEA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom throughall the land', 'Nothing was hidden from him and it seemed as if news ofthe most secret things was brought to him through the air', 'But he had astrange custom every day after dinner when the table was clearedand no one else was present a trusty servant had to bring him one moredish', 'It was covered however and even the servant did not know whatwas in it neither did anyone know for the king never took off thecover to eat of it until he was quite alone.This had gone on for a long time when one day the servant who tookaway the dish was overcome with such curiosity that he could not helpcarrying the dish into his room', 'When he had carefully locked the doorhe lifted up the cover and saw a white snake lying on the dish', 'Butwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting itso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth', 'No sooner had ittouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voicesoutside his window', 'He went and listened and then noticed that it wasthe sparrows who were chattering together and telling one another ofall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods', 'Eatingthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her mostbeautiful ring and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trustyservant who was allowed to go everywhere', 'The king ordered the man tobe brought before him and threatened with angry words that unless hecould before the morrow point out the thief he himself should be lookedupon as guilty and executed', 'In vain he declared his innocence he wasdismissed with no better answer.In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thoughthow to help himself out of his trouble', 'Now some ducks were sittingtogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest and whilst theywere making their feathers smooth with their bills they were having aconfidential conversation together', 'The servant stood by and listened.They were telling one another of all the places where they had beenwaddling about all the morning and what good food they had found andone said in a pitiful tone Something lies heavy on my stomach asI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queenswindow', 'The servant at once seized her by the neck carried her to thekitchen and said to the cook Here is a fine duck pray kill her.Yes said the cook and weighed her in his hand she has sparedno trouble to fatten herself and has been waiting to be roasted longenough', 'So he cut off her head and as she was being dressed for thespit the queens ring was found inside her.The servant could now easily prove his innocence and the king to makeamends for the wrong allowed him to ask a favour and promised himthe best place in the court that he could wish for', 'The servant refusedeverything and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling ashe had a mind to see the world and go about a little', 'When his requestwas granted he set out on his way and one day came to a pond where hesaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water', 'Now thoughit is said that fishes are dumb he heard them lamenting that they mustperish so miserably and as he had a kind heart he got off hishorse and put the three prisoners back into the water', 'They leapt withdelight put out their heads and cried to him We will remember youand repay you for saving usHe rode on and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice inthe sand at his feet', 'He listened and heard an antking complain Whycannot folks with their clumsy beasts keep off our bodies That stupidhorse with his heavy hoofs has been treading down my people withoutmercy So he turned on to a side path and the antking cried out tohim We will remember youone good turn deserves anotherThe path led him into a wood and there he saw two old ravens standingby their nest and throwing out their young ones', 'Out with you youidle goodfornothing creatures cried they we cannot find food foryou any longer you are big enough and can provide for yourselves.But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground flapping their wings andcrying Oh what helpless chicks we are We must shift for ourselvesand yet we cannot fly What can we do but lie here and starve So thegood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword and gaveit to them for food', 'Then they came hopping up to it satisfied theirhunger and cried We will remember youone good turn deservesanotherAnd now he had to use his own legs and when he had walked a longway he came to a large city', 'There was a great noise and crowd inthe streets and a man rode up on horseback crying aloud The kingsdaughter wants a husband but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hardtask and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life', 'Many hadalready made the attempt but in vain nevertheless when the youthsaw the kings daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that heforgot all danger went before the king and declared himself a suitor.So he was led out to the sea and a gold ring was thrown into it beforehis eyes then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from thebottom of the sea and added If you come up again without it you willbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves', 'All thepeople grieved for the handsome youth then they went away leaving himalone by the sea.He stood on the shore and considered what he should do when suddenlyhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him and they were the veryfishes whose lives he had saved', 'The one in the middle held a mussel inits mouth which it laid on the shore at the youths feet and when hehad taken it up and opened it there lay the gold ring in the shell.Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant himthe promised reward.But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal inbirth she scorned him and required him first to perform anothertask', 'She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands tensacksful of milletseed on the grass then she said Tomorrow morningbefore sunrise these must be picked up and not a single grain bewanting.The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possibleto perform this task but he could think of nothing and there he satsorrowfully awaiting the break of day when he should be led to death.But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he sawall the ten sacks standing side by side quite full and not a singlegrain was missing', 'The antking had come in the night with thousandsand thousands of ants and the grateful creatures had by great industrypicked up all the milletseed and gathered them into the sacks.Presently the kings daughter herself came down into the garden and wasamazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.But she could not yet conquer her proud heart and said Although hehas performed both the tasks he shall not be my husband until he hadbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life', 'The youth did not know wherethe Tree of Life stood but he set out and would have gone on for everas long as his legs would carry him though he had no hope of findingit', 'After he had wandered through three kingdoms he came one evening toa wood and lay down under a tree to sleep', 'But he heard a rustling inthe branches and a golden apple fell into his hand', 'At the same timethree ravens flew down to him perched themselves upon his knee andsaid We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving whenwe had grown big and heard that you were seeking the Golden Applewe flew over the sea to the end of the world where the Tree of Lifestands and have brought you the apple', 'The youth full of joy set outhomewards and took the Golden Apple to the kings beautiful daughterwho had now no more excuses left to make', 'They cut the Apple of Life intwo and ate it together and then her heart became full of love for himand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDSThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids andloved them with all the love of a mother for her children', 'One day shewanted to go into the forest and fetch some food', 'So she called allseven to her and said Dear children I have to go into the forestbe on your guard against the wolf if he comes in he will devour youallskin hair and everything', 'The wretch often disguises himself butyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet', 'Thekids said Dear mother we will take good care of ourselves you may goaway without any anxiety', 'Then the old one bleated and went on her waywith an easy mind.It was not long before someone knocked at the housedoor and calledOpen the door dear children your mother is here and has broughtsomething back with her for each of you', 'But the little kids knew thatit was the wolf by the rough voice', 'We will not open the door criedthey you are not our mother', 'She has a soft pleasant voice butyour voice is rough you are the wolf Then the wolf went away to ashopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk ate this and madehis voice soft with it', 'Then he came back knocked at the door of thehouse and called Open the door dear children your mother is hereand has brought something back with her for each of you', 'But the wolfhad laid his black paws against the window and the children saw themand cried We will not open the door our mother has not black feetlike you you are the wolf Then the wolf ran to a baker and said Ihave hurt my feet rub some dough over them for me', 'And when the bakerhad rubbed his feet over he ran to the miller and said Strew somewhite meal over my feet for me', 'The miller thought to himself Thewolf wants to deceive someone and refused but the wolf said If youwill not do it I will devour you', 'Then the miller was afraid and madehis paws white for him', 'Truly this is the way of mankind.So now the wretch went for the third time to the housedoor knocked atit and said Open the door for me children your dear little motherhas come home and has brought every one of you something back from theforest with her', 'The little kids cried First show us your paws thatwe may know if you are our dear little mother', 'Then he put his pawsin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white theybelieved that all he said was true and opened the door', 'But who shouldcome in but the wolf They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.One sprang under the table the second into the bed the third into thestove the fourth into the kitchen the fifth into the cupboard thesixth under the washingbowl and the seventh into the clockcase', 'Butthe wolf found them all and used no great ceremony one after theother he swallowed them down his throat', 'The youngest who was inthe clockcase was the only one he did not find', 'When the wolf hadsatisfied his appetite he took himself off laid himself down under atree in the green meadow outside and began to sleep', 'Soon afterwardsthe old goat came home again from the forest', 'Ah what a sight she sawthere The housedoor stood wide open', 'The table chairs and bencheswere thrown down the washingbowl lay broken to pieces and the quiltsand pillows were pulled off the bed', 'She sought her children but theywere nowhere to be found', 'She called them one after another by name butno one answered', 'At last when she came to the youngest a soft voicecried Dear mother I am in the clockcase', 'She took the kid out andit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others', 'Thenyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.At length in her grief she went out and the youngest kid ran with her.When they came to the meadow there lay the wolf by the tree and snoredso loud that the branches shook', 'She looked at him on every side andsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly', 'Ahheavens she said is it possible that my poor children whom he hasswallowed down for his supper can be still alive Then the kid had torun home and fetch scissors and a needle and thread and the goat cutopen the monsters stomach and hardly had she made one cut than onelittle kid thrust its head out and when she had cut farther all sixsprang out one after another and were all still alive and had sufferedno injury whatever for in his greediness the monster had swallowed themdown whole', 'What rejoicing there was They embraced their dear motherand jumped like a tailor at his wedding', 'The mother however said Nowgo and look for some big stones and we will fill the wicked beastsstomach with them while he is still asleep', 'Then the seven kids draggedthe stones thither with all speed and put as many of them into thisstomach as they could get in and the mother sewed him up again in thegreatest haste so that he was not aware of anything and never oncestirred.When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep he got on his legsand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty he wanted togo to a well to drink', 'But when he began to walk and to move about thestones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled', 'Then criedhe What rumbles and tumbles  Against my poor bones  I thought twas six kids  But it feels like big stones.And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink theheavy stones made him fall in and he drowned miserably', 'When the sevenkids saw that they came running to the spot and cried aloud The wolfis dead The wolf is dead and danced for joy round about the well withtheir mother.THE QUEEN BEETwo kings sons once upon a time went into the world to seek theirfortunes but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living sothat they could not return home again', 'Then their brother who was alittle insignificant dwarf went out to seek for his brothers but whenhe had found them they only laughed at him to think that he who was soyoung and simple should try to travel through the world when they whowere so much wiser had been unable to get on', 'However they all setout on their journey together and came at last to an anthill', 'The twoelder brothers would have pulled it down in order to see how the poorants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs', 'But thelittle dwarf said Let the poor things enjoy themselves I will notsuffer you to trouble them.So on they went and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimmingabout', 'The two brothers wanted to catch two and roast them', 'But thedwarf said Let the poor things enjoy themselves you shall not killthem', 'Next they came to a beesnest in a hollow tree and there wasso much honey that it ran down the trunk and the two brothers wanted tolight a fire under the tree and kill the bees so as to get their honey.But the dwarf held them back and said Let the pretty insects enjoythemselves I cannot let you burn them.At length the three brothers came to a castle and as they passed by thestables they saw fine horses standing there but all were of marble andno man was to be seen', 'Then they went through all the rooms till theycame to a door on which were three locks but in the middle of the doorwas a wicket so that they could look into the next room', 'There they sawa little grey old man sitting at a table and they called to him once ortwice but he did not hear however they called a third time and thenhe rose and came out to them.He said nothing but took hold of them and led them to a beautifultable covered with all sorts of good things and when they had eaten anddrunk he showed each of them to a bedchamber.The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble tablewhere there were three tablets containing an account of the means bywhich the castle might be disenchanted', 'The first tablet said In thewood under the moss lie the thousand pearls belonging to the kingsdaughter they must all be found and if one be missing by set of sunhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.The eldest brother set out and sought for the pearls the whole daybut the evening came and he had not found the first hundred so he wasturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.The next day the second brother undertook the task but he succeeded nobetter than the first for he could only find the second hundred of thepearls and therefore he too was turned into stone.At last came the little dwarfs turn and he looked in the moss but itwas so hard to find the pearls and the job was so tiresomeso he satdown upon a stone and cried', 'And as he sat there the king of the antswhose life he had saved came to help him with five thousand ants andit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in aheap.The second tablet said The key of the princesss bedchamber must befished up out of the lake', 'And as the dwarf came to the brink of ithe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about and theydived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.The third task was the hardest', 'It was to choose out the youngest andthe best of the kings three daughters', 'Now they were all beautiful andall exactly alike but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece ofsugar the next some sweet syrup and the youngest a spoonful of honeyso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.Then came the queen of the bees who had been saved by the little dwarffrom the fire and she tried the lips of all three but at last she satupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey and so the dwarf knewwhich was the youngest', 'Thus the spell was broken and all who had beenturned into stones awoke and took their proper forms', 'And the dwarfmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses and was king afterher fathers death but his two brothers married the other two sisters.THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKERThere was once a shoemaker who worked very hard and was very honestbut still he could not earn enough to live upon and at last all hehad in the world was gone save just leather enough to make one pair ofshoes.Then he cut his leather out all ready to make up the next day meaningto rise early in the morning to his work', 'His conscience was clear andhis heart light amidst all his troubles so he went peaceably to bedleft all his cares to Heaven and soon fell asleep', 'In the morning afterhe had said his prayers he sat himself down to his work when to hisgreat wonder there stood the shoes all ready made upon the table', 'Thegood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.He looked at the workmanship there was not one false stitch in thewhole job all was so neat and true that it was quite a masterpiece.The same day a customer came in and the shoes suited him so well thathe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them and the poorshoemaker with the money bought leather enough to make two pairs more.In the evening he cut out the work and went to bed early that he mightget up and begin betimes next day but he was saved all the trouble forwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand', 'Soonin came buyers who paid him handsomely for his goods so that he boughtleather enough for four pair more', 'He cut out the work again overnightand found it done in the morning as before and so it went on for sometime what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak andthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.One evening about Christmastime as he and his wife were sitting overthe fire chatting together he said to her I should like to sit up andwatch tonight that we may see who it is that comes and does my work forme', 'The wife liked the thought so they left a light burning and hidthemselves in a corner of the room behind a curtain that was hung upthere and watched what would happen.As soon as it was midnight there came in two little naked dwarfs andthey sat themselves upon the shoemakers bench took up all the workthat was cut out and began to ply with their little fingers stitchingand rapping and tapping away at such a rate that the shoemaker was allwonder and could not take his eyes off them', 'And on they went till thejob was quite done and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.This was long before daybreak and then they bustled away as quick aslightning.The next day the wife said to the shoemaker', 'These little wights havemade us rich and we ought to be thankful to them and do them a goodturn if we can', 'I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do andindeed it is not very decent for they have nothing upon their backs tokeep off the cold', 'Ill tell you what I will make each of them a shirtand a coat and waistcoat and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain anddo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.The thought pleased the good cobbler very much and one evening whenall the things were ready they laid them on the table instead of thework that they used to cut out and then went and hid themselves towatch what the little elves would do.About midnight in they came dancing and skipping hopped round theroom and then went to sit down to their work as usual but when theysaw the clothes lying for them they laughed and chuckled and seemedmightily delighted.Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye and danced andcapered and sprang about as merry as could be till at last they dancedout at the door and away over the green.The good couple saw them no more but everything went well with themfrom that time forward as long as they lived.THE JUNIPERTREELong long ago some two thousand years or so there lived a richman with a good and beautiful wife', 'They loved each other dearly butsorrowed much that they had no children', 'So greatly did they desireto have one that the wife prayed for it day and night but still theyremained childless.In front of the house there was a court in which grew a junipertree.One winters day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples andas she was peeling them she cut her finger and the blood fell on thesnow', 'Ah sighed the woman heavily if I had but a child as red asblood and as white as snow and as she spoke the words her heart grewlight within her and it seemed to her that her wish was granted andshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted', 'A month passedand the snow had all disappeared then another month went by and allthe earth was green', 'So the months followed one another and first thetrees budded in the woods and soon the green branches grew thicklyintertwined and then the blossoms began to fall', 'Once again the wifestood under the junipertree and it was so full of sweet scent that herheart leaped for joy and she was so overcome with her happiness thatshe fell on her knees', 'Presently the fruit became round and firm andshe was glad and at peace but when they were fully ripe she picked theberries and ate eagerly of them and then she grew sad and ill', 'A littlewhile later she called her husband and said to him weeping', 'If Idie bury me under the junipertree', 'Then she felt comforted and happyagain and before another month had passed she had a little child andwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood her joywas so great that she died.Her husband buried her under the junipertree and wept bitterly forher', 'By degrees however his sorrow grew less and although at times hestill grieved over his loss he was able to go about as usual and lateron he married again.He now had a little daughter born to him the child of his first wifewas a boy who was as red as blood and as white as snow', 'The motherloved her daughter very much and when she looked at her and then lookedat the boy it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand inthe way of her own child and she was continually thinking how she couldget the whole of the property for her', 'This evil thought took possessionof her more and more and made her behave very unkindly to the boy', 'Shedrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings so that thepoor child went about in fear and had no peace from the time he leftschool to the time he went back.One day the little daughter came running to her mother in thestoreroom and said Mother give me an apple', 'Yes my child saidthe wife and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest the chesthad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.Mother said the little daughter again may not brother have onetoo The mother was angry at this but she answered Yes when hecomes out of school.Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming and it seemedas if an evil spirit entered into her for she snatched the apple outof her little daughters hand and said You shall not have one beforeyour brother', 'She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to', 'Thelittle boy now came in and the evil spirit in the wife made her saykindly to him My son will you have an apple but she gave him awicked look', 'Mother said the boy how dreadful you look Yes giveme an apple', 'The thought came to her that she would kill him', 'Comewith me she said and she lifted up the lid of the chest take oneout for yourself', 'And as he bent over to do so the evil spirit urgedher and crash down went the lid and off went the little boys head.Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it she thought', 'Soshe went upstairs to her room and took a white handkerchief out ofher top drawer then she set the boys head again on his shoulders andbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen and placedhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.Soon after this little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirringa pot of boiling water over the fire and said Mother brother issitting by the door with an apple in his hand and he looks so paleand when I asked him to give me the apple he did not answer and thatfrightened me.Go to him again said her mother and if he does not answer give hima box on the ear', 'So little Marleen went and said Brother give methat apple but he did not say a word then she gave him a box on theear and his head rolled off', 'She was so terrified at this that she rancrying and screaming to her mother', 'Oh she said I have knocked offbrothers head and then she wept and wept and nothing would stop her.What have you done said her mother but no one must know about itso you must keep silence what is done cant be undone we will makehim into puddings', 'And she took the little boy and cut him up made himinto puddings and put him in the pot', 'But Marleen stood looking onand wept and wept and her tears fell into the pot so that there was noneed of salt.Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner he askedWhere is my son The mother said nothing but gave him a large dish ofblack pudding and Marleen still wept without ceasing.The father again asked Where is my sonOh answered the wife he is gone into the country to his mothersgreat uncle he is going to stay there some time.What has he gone there for and he never even said goodbye to meWell he likes being there and he told me he should be away quite sixweeks he is well looked after there.I feel very unhappy about it said the husband in case it should notbe all right and he ought to have said goodbye to me.With this he went on with his dinner and said Little Marleen why doyou weep Brother will soon be back', 'Then he asked his wife for morepudding and as he ate he threw the bones under the table.Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out ofher bottom drawer and in it she wrapped all the bones from under thetable and carried them outside and all the time she did nothing butweep', 'Then she laid them in the green grass under the junipertree andshe had no sooner done so then all her sadness seemed to leave herand she wept no more', 'And now the junipertree began to move and thebranches waved backwards and forwards first away from one another andthen together again as it might be someone clapping their hands forjoy', 'After this a mist came round the tree and in the midst of it therewas a burning as of fire and out of the fire there flew a beautifulbird that rose high into the air singing magnificently and when itcould no more be seen the junipertree stood there as before and thesilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother werestill alive and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully tothe table and ate.The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began tosing My mother killed her little son  My father grieved when I was gone  My sister loved me best of all  She laid her kerchief over me  And took my

thought it so beautiful that he gotup and ran out and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of hisslippers', 'But he ran on into the middle of the street with a slipper onone foot and a sock on the other he still had on his apron and stillheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands and so he stood gazingup at the bird while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.Bird he said how beautifully you sing Sing me that song again.Nay said the bird I do not sing twice for nothing', 'Give that goldchain and I will sing it you again.Here is the chain take it said the goldsmith', 'Only

and look at itand hear how beautifully it sings', 'Then he called his daughter and thechildren then the apprentices girls and boys and they all ran up thestreet to look at the bird and saw how splendid it was with its redand green feathers and its neck like burnished gold and eyes like twobright stars in its head.Bird said the shoemaker sing me that song again.Nay answered the bird I do not sing twice for nothing you mustgive me something.Wife said the man go into the garret on the upper shelf you willsee a pair of red shoes bring them to me', 'The wife went in and fetchedthe shoes.There

house.The father the mother and little Marleen were having their dinner.How lighthearted I feel said the father so pleased and cheerful.And I said the mother I feel so uneasy as if a heavy thunderstormwere coming.But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.I do feel so happy said the father and how beautifully the sunshines I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.Ah said the wife and I am so full of distress and uneasiness thatmy teeth chatter and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins andshe tore open her dress and all the while little Marleen sat in thecorner and wept and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.The bird now flew to the junipertree and began singing My mother killed her little sonthe mother shut her eyes and her ears that she might see and hearnothing but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of aviolent storm and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning  My father grieved when I was goneLook mother said the man at the beautiful bird that is singing somagnificently and how warm and bright the sun is and what a deliciousscent of

feel as if the whole house were inflamesBut the man went out and looked at the bird', 'She laid her kerchief over me And took my bones that they might lie Underneath the junipertree Kywitt Kywitt what a beautiful bird am IWith that the bird let fall the gold chain and it fell just round themans neck so that it fitted him exactly.He went inside and said See what a splendid bird that is he hasgiven

killed her little sonAh me cried the wife if I were but a thousand feet beneath theearth that I might not hear that song', ' My father grieved when I was gonethen the woman fell down again as if dead', ' My sister loved me best of allWell said little Marleen I will go out too and see if the bird willgive me anything.So she went out', ' She laid her kerchief over me  And took my bones that

jumped about in them', 'I was so miserable she said when Icame out but that has all passed away that is indeed a splendid birdand he has given me a pair of red shoes.The wife sprang up with her hair standing out from her head like flamesof fire', 'Then I will go out too she said and see if it will lightenmy misery for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.But as she crossed the threshold crash the bird threw the millstonedown on her head and she was crushed to death.The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out but they onlysaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot and when these hadpassed there stood the little brother and he took the father andlittle Marleen by the hand then they all three rejoiced and wentinside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.THE TURNIPThere were two brothers who were both soldiers the one was rich andthe other poor', 'The poor man thought he would try to better himself sopulling off his red coat he became a gardener and dug his ground welland sowed turnips.When the seed came up there was one plant bigger than all the rest andit kept getting larger and larger and seemed as if it would never ceasegrowing so that it might have been called the prince of turnips forthere never was such a one seen before and never will again', 'At last itwas so big that it filled a cart and two oxen could hardly draw it andthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it nor whether itwould be a blessing or a curse to him', 'One day he said to himself Whatshall I do with it if I sell it it will bring no more than anotherand for eating the little turnips are better than this the best thingperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.Then he yoked his oxen and drew the turnip to the court and gave itto the king', 'What a wonderful thing said the king I have seen manystrange things but such a monster as this I never saw', 'Where did youget the seed or is it only your good luck If so you are a true childof fortune', 'Ah no answered the gardener I am no child of fortuneI am a poor soldier who never could get enough to live upon so Ilaid aside my red coat and set to work tilling the ground', 'I have abrother who is rich and your majesty knows him well and all the worldknows him but because I am poor everybody forgets me.The king then took pity on him and said You shall be poor nolonger', 'I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than yourbrother', 'Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks and made him sorich that his brothers fortune could not at all be compared with his.When the brother heard of all this and how a turnip had made thegardener so rich he envied him sorely and bethought himself how hecould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself', 'However hedetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother and got together arich present of gold and fine horses for the king and thought he musthave a much larger gift in return for if his brother had received somuch for only a turnip what must his present be worthThe king took the gift very graciously and said he knew not what togive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip sothe soldier was forced to put it into a cart and drag it home with him.When he reached home he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spiteand at length wicked thoughts came into his head and he resolved tokill his brother.So he hired some villains to murder him and having shown them where tolie in ambush he went to his brother and said Dear brother I havefound a hidden treasure let us go and dig it up and share it betweenus', 'The other had no suspicions of his roguery so they went outtogether and as they were travelling along the murderers rushed outupon him bound him and were going to hang him on a tree.But whilst they were getting all ready they heard the trampling of ahorse at a distance which so frightened them that they pushed theirprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack and swung him up by acord to the tree where they left him dangling and ran away', 'Meantimehe worked and worked away till he made a hole large enough to put outhis head.When the horseman came up he proved to be a student a merry fellowwho was journeying along on his nag and singing as he went', 'As soon asthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree he cried out Goodmorning good morning to thee my friend The student looked abouteverywhere and seeing no one and not knowing where the voice camefrom cried out Who calls meThen the man in the tree answered Lift up thine eyes for behold hereI sit in the sack of wisdom here have I in a short time learned greatand wondrous things', 'Compared to this seat all the learning of theschools is as empty air', 'A little longer and I shall know all that mancan know and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind', 'HereI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars the lawsthat control the winds the number of the sands on the seashore thehealing of the sick the virtues of all simples of birds and ofprecious stones', 'Wert thou but once here my friend though wouldst feeland own the power of knowledge.The student listened to all this and wondered much at last he saidBlessed be the day and hour when I found you cannot you contrive tolet me into the sack for a little while Then the other answered as ifvery unwillingly A little space I may allow thee to sit here if thouwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly but thou must tarry yet anhour below till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknownto me.So the student sat himself down and waited a while but the time hungheavy upon him and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwithfor his thirst for knowledge was great', 'Then the other pretended to giveway and said Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend by untyingyonder cord and then thou shalt enter', 'So the student let him downopened the sack and set him free', 'Now then cried he let me ascendquickly', 'As he began to put himself into the sack heels first Wait awhile said the gardener that is not the way', 'Then he pushed himin head first tied up the sack and soon swung up the searcher afterwisdom dangling in the air', 'How is it with thee friend said hedost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee Rest there in peacetill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.So saying he trotted off on the students nag and left the poor fellowto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.CLEVER HANSThe mother of Hans said Whither away Hans

father Hark youmy son try as I will I can get nothing into your head', 'You must go fromhence I will give you into the care of a celebrated master who shallsee what he can do with you', 'The youth was sent into a strange townand remained a whole year with the master', 'At the end of this timehe came home again and his father asked Now my son what have youlearnt Father I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark', 'Lordhave mercy on us cried the father is that all you have learnt Iwill send you into another town to another master', 'The youth was takenthither and stayed a year with this master likewise', 'When he came backthe father again asked My son what have you learnt He answeredFather I have learnt what the birds say', 'Then the father fell into arage and said Oh you lost man you have spent the precious time andlearnt nothing are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes I willsend you to a third master but if you learn nothing this time also Iwill no longer be your father', 'The youth remained a whole year with thethird master also and when he came home again and his father inquiredMy son what have you learnt he answered Dear father I have thisyear learnt what the frogs croak', 'Then the father fell into the mostfurious anger sprang up called his people thither and said This manis no longer my son I drive him forth and command you to take himout into the forest and kill him', 'They took him forth but when theyshould have killed him they could not do it for pity and let him goand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carrythem to the old man as a token.The youth wandered on and after some time came to a fortress where hebegged for a nights lodging', 'Yes said the lord of the castle ifyou will pass the night down there in the old tower go thither but Iwarn you it is at the peril of your life for it is full of wild dogswhich bark and howl without stopping and at certain hours a man has tobe given to them whom they at once devour', 'The whole district was insorrow and dismay because of them and yet no one could do anything tostop this', 'The youth however was without fear and said Just let mego down to the barking dogs and give me something that I can throw tothem they will do nothing to harm me', 'As he himself would have it sothey gave him some food for the wild animals and led him down to thetower', 'When he went inside the dogs did not bark at him but waggedtheir tails quite amicably around him ate what he set before them anddid not hurt one hair of his head', 'Next morning to the astonishment ofeveryone he came out again safe and unharmed and said to the lord ofthe castle The dogs have revealed to me in their own language whythey dwell there and bring evil on the land', 'They are bewitched andare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the towerand they can have no rest until it is taken away and I have likewiselearnt from their discourse how that is to be done', 'Then all whoheard this rejoiced and the lord of the castle said he would adopt himas a son if he accomplished it successfully', 'He went down again andas he knew what he had to do he did it thoroughly and brought a chestfull of gold out with him', 'The howling of the wild dogs was henceforthheard no more they had disappeared and the country was freed from thetrouble.After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome', 'Onthe way he passed by a marsh in which a number of frogs were sittingcroaking', 'He listened to them and when he became aware of what theywere saying he grew very thoughtful and sad', 'At last he arrived inRome where the Pope had just died and there was great doubt amongthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor', 'They atlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should bedistinguished by some divine and miraculous token', 'And just as that wasdecided on the young count entered into the church and suddenly twosnowwhite doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there', 'Theecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above and asked him onthe spot if he would be pope', 'He was undecided and knew not if he wereworthy of this but the doves counselled him to do it and at length hesaid yes', 'Then was he anointed and consecrated and thus was fulfilledwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way which had so affected himthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope', 'Then he had to sing a mass anddid not know one word of it but the two doves sat continually on hisshoulders and said it all in his ear.THE FOX AND THE CATIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest and as she thought toherself He is clever and full of experience and much esteemed in theworld she spoke to him in a friendly way', 'Good day dear Mr Foxhow are you How is all with you How are you getting on in these hardtimes The fox full of all kinds of arrogance looked at the cat fromhead to foot and for a long time did not know whether he would giveany answer or not', 'At last he said Oh you wretched beardcleaner youpiebald fool you hungry mousehunter what can you be thinking of Haveyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on What have you learnt Howmany arts do you understand I understand but one replied thecat modestly', 'What art is that asked the fox', 'When the hounds arefollowing me I can spring into a tree and save myself', 'Is that allsaid the fox', 'I am master of a hundred arts and have into the bargaina sackful of cunning', 'You make me sorry for you come with me I willteach you how people get away from the hounds', 'Just then came a hunterwith four dogs', 'The cat sprang nimbly up a tree and sat down at the topof it where the branches and foliage quite concealed her', 'Open yoursack Mr Fox open your sack cried the cat to him but the dogs hadalready seized him and were holding him fast', 'Ah Mr Fox cried thecat', 'You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch Had you beenable to climb like me you would not have lost your life.THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERSDear children said a poor man to his four sons I have nothing togive you you must go out into the wide world and try your luck', 'Beginby learning some craft or another and see how you can get on', 'So thefour brothers took their walkingsticks in their hands and their littlebundles on their shoulders and after bidding their father goodbye wentall out at the gate together', 'When they had got on some way they cameto four crossways each leading to a different country', 'Then the eldestsaid Here we must part but this day four years we will come backto this spot and in the meantime each must try what he can do forhimself.So each brother went his way and as the eldest was hastening on a manmet him and asked him where he was going and what he wanted', 'I amgoing to try my luck in the world and should like to begin by learningsome art or trade answered he', 'Then said the man go with me andI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was', 'Nosaid the other that is not an honest calling and what can one lookto earn by it in the end but the gallows Oh said the man you neednot fear the gallows for I will only teach you to steal what will befair game I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or careanything about and where no one can find you out', 'So the young managreed to follow his trade and he soon showed himself so clever thatnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.The second brother also met a man who when he found out what he wassetting out upon asked him what craft he meant to follow', 'I do notknow yet said he', 'Then come with me and be a stargazer', 'It is anoble art for nothing can be hidden from you when once you understandthe stars', 'The plan pleased him much and he soon became such a skilfulstargazer that when he had served out his time and wanted to leavehis master he gave him a glass and said With this you can see allthat is passing in the sky and on earth and nothing can be hidden fromyou.The third brother met a huntsman who took him with him and taught himso well all that belonged to hunting that he became very clever in thecraft of the woods and when he left his master he gave him a bow andsaid Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished todo', 'Would not you like said he to be a tailor Oh no saidthe young man sitting crosslegged from morning to night workingbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose will never suit me.Oh answered the man that is not my sort of tailoring come with meand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that', 'Not knowingwhat better to do he came into the plan and learnt tailoring from thebeginning and when he left his master he gave him a needle and saidYou can sew anything with this be it as soft as an egg or as hard assteel and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.After the space of four years at the time agreed upon the fourbrothers met at the four crossroads and having welcomed each otherset off towards their fathers home where they told him all that hadhappened to them and how each had learned some craft.Then one day as they were sitting before the house under a very hightree the father said I should like to try what each of you can do inthis way', 'So he looked up and said to the second son At the top ofthis tree there is a chaffinchs nest tell me how many eggs there arein it', 'The stargazer took his glass looked up and said Five.Now said the father to the eldest son take away the eggs withoutletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them knowanything of what you are doing', 'So the cunning thief climbed up thetree and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the birdand it never saw or felt what he was doing but kept sitting on at itsease', 'Then the father took the eggs and put one on each corner of thetable and the fifth in the middle and said to the huntsman Cut allthe eggs in two pieces at one shot', 'The huntsman took up his bow andat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.Now comes your turn said he to the young tailor sew the eggs andthe young birds in them together again so neatly that the shot shallhave done them no harm', 'Then the tailor took his needle and sewed theeggs as he was told and when he had done the thief was sent to takethem back to the nest and put them under the bird without its knowingit', 'Then she went on sitting and hatched them and in a few days theycrawled out and had only a little red streak across their necks wherethe tailor had sewn them together.Well done sons said the old man you have made good use of yourtime and learnt something worth the knowing but I am sure I do notknow which ought to have the prize', 'Oh that a time might soon come foryou to turn your skill to some accountNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country for thekings daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon and the kingmourned over his loss day and night and made it known that whoeverbrought her back to him should have her for a wife', 'Then the fourbrothers said to each other Here is a chance for us let us trywhat we can do', 'And they agreed to see whether they could not set theprincess free', 'I will soon find out where she is however said thestargazer as he looked through his glass and he soon cried out Isee her afar off sitting upon a rock in the sea and I can spy thedragon close by guarding her', 'Then he went to the king and asked fora ship for himself and his brothers and they sailed together over thesea till they came to the right place', 'There they found the princesssitting as the stargazer had said on the rock and the dragon waslying asleep with his head upon her lap', 'I dare not shoot at himsaid the huntsman for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.Then I will try my skill said the thief and went and stole her awayfrom under the dragon so quietly and gently that the beast did not knowit but went on snoring.Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards theship but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air forhe awoke and missed the princess', 'But when he got over the boat andwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess the huntsman tookup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell downdead', 'They were still not safe for he was such a great beast that inhis fall he overset the boat and they had to swim in the open seaupon a few planks', 'So the tailor took his needle and with a few largestitches put some of the planks together and he sat down upon theseand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat and then tackedthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready and they thenreached the ship and got home safe.When they had brought home the princess to her father there was greatrejoicing and he said to the four brothers One of you shall marryher but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be', 'Thenthere arose a quarrel between them and the stargazer said If I hadnot found the princess out all your skill would have been of no usetherefore she ought to be mine', 'Your seeing her would have been ofno use said the thief if I had not taken her away from the dragontherefore she ought to be mine', 'No she is mine said the huntsmanfor if I had not killed the dragon he would after all have torn youand the princess into pieces', 'And if I had not sewn the boat togetheragain said the tailor you would all have been drowned therefore sheis mine', 'Then the king put in a word and said Each of you is rightand as all cannot have the young lady the best way is for neither ofyou to have her for the truth is there is somebody she likes a greatdeal better', 'But to make up for your loss I will give each of you as areward for his skill half a kingdom', 'So the brothers agreed that thisplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady whohad no mind to have them', 'And the king then gave to each half a kingdomas he had said and they lived very happily the rest of their days andtook good care of their father and somebody took better care of theyoung lady than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen haveher again.LILY AND THE LIONA merchant who had three daughters was once setting out upon ajourney but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he shouldbring back for her', 'The eldest wished for pearls the second for jewelsbut the third who was called Lily said Dear father bring me arose', 'Now it was no easy task to find a rose for it was the middleof winter yet as she was his prettiest daughter and was very fond offlowers her father said he would try what he could do', 'So he kissed allthree and bid them goodbye.And when the time came for him to go home he had bought pearls andjewels for the two eldest but he had sought everywhere in vain for therose and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing thepeople laughed at him and asked him whether he thought roses grew insnow', 'This grieved him very much for Lily was his dearest child and ashe was journeying home thinking what he should bring her he came to afine castle and around the castle was a garden in one half of which itseemed to be summertime and in the other half winter', 'On one side thefinest flowers were in full bloom and on the other everything lookeddreary and buried in the snow', 'A lucky hit said he as he called tohis servant and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that wasthere and bring him away one of the finest flowers.This done they were riding away well pleased when up sprang a fiercelion and roared out Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten upalive Then the man said I knew not that the garden belonged to youcan nothing save my life No said the lion nothing unless youundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home if youagree to this I will give you your life and the rose too for yourdaughter', 'But the man was unwilling to do so and said It may be myyoungest daughter who loves me most and always runs to meet me whenI go home', 'Then the servant was greatly frightened and said It mayperhaps be only a cat or a dog', 'And at last the man yielded with aheavy heart and took the rose and said he would give the lion whatevershould meet him first on his return.And as he came near home it was Lily his youngest and dearestdaughter that met him she came running and kissed him and welcomedhim home and when she saw that he had brought her the rose she wasstill more glad', 'But her father began to be very sorrowful and to weepsaying Alas my dearest child I have bought this flower at a highprice for I have said I would give you to a wild lion and when he hasyou he will tear you in pieces and eat you', 'Then he told her all thathad happened and said she should not go let what would happen.But she comforted him and said Dear father the word you have givenmust be kept I will go to the lion and soothe him perhaps he will letme come safe home again.The next morning she asked the way she was to go and took leave of herfather and went forth with a bold heart into the wood', 'But the lion wasan enchanted prince', 'By day he and all his court were lions but in theevening they took their right forms again', 'And when Lily came to thecastle he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him', 'Theweddingfeast was held and they lived happily together a long time', 'Theprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came and then he held hiscourt but every morning he left his bride and went away by himselfshe knew not whither till the night came again.After some time he said to her Tomorrow there will be a great feast inyour fathers house for your eldest sister is to be married and ifyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither', 'Then sherejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more and setout with the lions and everyone was overjoyed to see her for they hadthought her dead long since', 'But she told them how happy she was andstayed till the feast was over and then went back to the wood.Her second sister was soon after married and when Lily was asked togo to the wedding she said to the prince I will not go alone thistimeyou must go with me', 'But he would not and said that it would bea very hazardous thing for if the least ray of the torchlight shouldfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse for he should bechanged into a dove and be forced to wander about the world for sevenlong years', 'However she gave him no rest and said she would take careno light should fall upon him', 'So at last they set out together andtook with them their little child and she chose a large hall with thickwalls for him to sit in while the weddingtorches were lighted butunluckily no one saw that there was a crack in the door', 'Then thewedding was held with great pomp but as the train came from the churchand passed with the torches before the hall a very small ray of lightfell upon the prince', 'In a moment he disappeared and when his wife camein and looked for him she found only a white dove and it said to herSeven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth butevery now and then I will let fall a white feather that will show youthe way I am going follow it and at last you may overtake and set mefree.This said he flew out at the door and poor Lily followed and everynow and then a white feather fell and showed her the way she was tojourney', 'Thus she went roving on through the wide world and lookedneither to the right hand nor to the left nor took any rest for sevenyears', 'Then she began to be glad and thought to herself that the timewas fast coming when all her troubles should end yet repose was stillfar off for one day as she was travelling on she missed the whitefeather and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.Now thought she to herself no aid of man can be of use to me', 'Soshe went to the sun and said Thou shinest everywhere on the hillstop and the valleys depthhast thou anywhere seen my white doveNo said the sun I have not seen it but I will give thee acasketopen it when thy hour of need comes.So she thanked the sun and went on her way till eventide and whenthe moon arose she cried unto it and said Thou shinest through thenight over field and grovehast thou nowhere seen my white doveNo said the moon I cannot help thee but I will give thee aneggbreak it when need comes.Then she thanked the moon and went on till the nightwind blew and sheraised up her voice to it and said Thou blowest through every treeand under every leafhast thou not seen my white dove No said thenightwind but I will ask three other winds perhaps they have seenit', 'Then the east wind and the west wind came and said they too hadnot seen it but the south wind said I have seen the white dovehehas fled to the Red Sea and is changed once more into a lion for theseven years are passed away and there he is fighting with a dragonand the dragon is an enchanted princess who seeks to separate him fromyou', 'Then the nightwind said I will give thee counsel', 'Go to theRed Sea on the right shore stand many rodscount them and when thoucomest to the eleventh break it off and smite the dragon with it andso the lion will have the victory and both of them will appear to youin their own forms', 'Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin wingedlike bird sitting by the Red Sea jump on to his back with thy belovedone as quickly as possible and he will carry you over the waters toyour home', 'I will also give thee this nut continued the nightwind.When you are halfway over throw it down and out of the waters willimmediately spring up a high nuttree on which the griffin will be ableto rest otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the wholeway if therefore thou dost forget to throw down the nut he will letyou both fall into the sea.So our poor wanderer went forth and found all as the nightwind hadsaid and she plucked the eleventh rod and smote the dragon and thelion forthwith became a prince and the dragon a princess again', 'Butno sooner was the princess released from the spell than she seizedthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffins back and went offcarrying the prince away with her.Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn but shetook heart and said As far as the wind blows and so long as the cockcrows I will journey on till I find him once again', 'She went on fora long long way till at length she came to the castle whither theprincess had carried the prince and there was a feast got ready andshe heard that the wedding was about to be held', 'Heaven aid me nowsaid she and she took the casket that the sun had given her and foundthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself', 'So she put iton and went into the palace and all the people gazed upon her andthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to besold', 'Not for gold and silver', 'said she but for flesh and blood.The princess asked what she meant and she said Let me speak with thebridegroom this night in his chamber and I will give thee the dress.At last the princess agreed but she told her chamberlain to give theprince a sleeping draught that he might not hear or see her', 'Whenevening came and the prince had fallen asleep she was led intohis chamber and she sat herself down at his feet and said I havefollowed thee seven years', 'I have been to the sun the moon and thenightwind to seek thee and at last I have helped thee to overcomethe dragon', 'Wilt thou then forget me quite But the prince all the timeslept so soundly that her voice only passed over him and seemed likethe whistling of the wind among the firtrees.Then poor Lily was led away and forced to give up the golden dress andwhen she saw that there was no help for her she went out into a meadowand sat herself down and wept', 'But as she sat she bethought herself ofthe egg that the moon had given her and when she broke it there ranout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold that played about and thennestled under the old ones wings so as to form the most beautifulsight in the world', 'And she rose up and drove them before her till thebride saw them from her window and was so pleased that she came forthand asked her if she would sell the brood', 'Not for gold or silver butfor flesh and blood let me again this evening speak with the bridegroomin his chamber and I will give thee the whole brood.Then the princess thought to betray her as before and agreed towhat she asked but when the prince went to his chamber he askedthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night', 'And thechamberlain told him allhow he had given him a sleeping draught andhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber and wasto come again that night', 'Then the prince took care to throw away thesleeping draught and when Lily came and began again to tell him whatwoes had befallen her and how faithful and true to him she had beenhe knew his beloved wifes voice and sprang up and said You haveawakened me as from a dream for the strange princess had thrown a spellaround me so that I had altogether forgotten you but Heaven hath sentyou to me in a lucky hour.And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares and seatedthemselves on the griffin who flew back with them over the Red Sea.When they were halfway across Lily let the nut fall into the waterand immediately a large nuttree arose from the sea whereon the griffinrested for a while and then carried them safely home', 'There they foundtheir child now grown up to be comely and fair and after all theirtroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.THE FOX AND THE HORSEA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant tohim but he was now grown too old to work so the farmer would give himnothing more to eat and said I want you no longer so take yourselfoff out of my stable I shall not take you back again until you arestronger than a lion', 'Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.The poor horse was very melancholy and wandered up and down in thewood seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain', 'Presentlya fox met him Whats the matter my friend said he why do you hangdown your head and look so lonely and woebegone Ah replied thehorse justice and avarice never dwell in one house my master hasforgotten all that I have done for him so many years and because Ican no longer work he has turned me adrift and says unless I becomestronger than a lion he will not take me back again what chance can Ihave of that he knows I have none or he would not talk so.However the fox bid him be of good cheer and said I will help youlie down there stretch yourself out quite stiff and pretend to bedead', 'The horse did as he was told and the fox went straight to thelion who lived in a cave close by and said to him A little way offlies a dead horse come with me and you may make an excellent meal ofhis carcase', 'The lion was greatly pleased and set off immediately andwhen they came to the horse the fox said You will not be able to eathim comfortably here Ill tell you whatI will tie you fast tohis tail and then you can draw him to your den and eat him at yourleisure.This advice pleased the lion so he laid himself down quietly for thefox to make him fast to the horse', 'But the fox managed to tie his legstogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength hecould not set himself free', 'When the work was done the fox clapped thehorse on the shoulder and said Jip Dobbin Jip Then up he sprangand moved off dragging the lion behind him', 'The beast began to roarand bellow till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright but thehorse let him sing on and made his way quietly over the fields to hismasters house.Here he is master said he I have got the better of him and whenthe farmer saw his old servant his heart relented and he said', 'Thoushalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of', 'And so the poor oldhorse had plenty to eat and livedtill he died.THE BLUE LIGHTThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served theking faithfully but when the war came to an end could serve no longerbecause of the many wounds which he had received', 'The king said to himYou may return to your home I need you no longer and you will notreceive any more money for he only receives wages who renders meservice for them', 'Then the soldier did not know how to earn a livingwent away greatly troubled and walked the whole day until in theevening he entered a forest', 'When darkness came on he saw a lightwhich he went up to and came to a house wherein lived a witch', 'Do giveme one nights lodging and a little to eat and drink said he toher or I shall starve', 'Oho she answered who gives anything to arunaway soldier Yet will I be compassionate and take you in if youwill do what I wish', 'What do you wish said the soldier', 'That youshould dig all round my garden for me tomorrow', 'The soldier consentedand next day laboured with all his strength but could not finish it bythe evening', 'I see well enough said the witch that you can do nomore today but I will keep you yet another night in payment forwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood and chop it small', 'Thesoldier spent the whole day in doing it and in the evening the witchproposed that he should stay one night more', 'Tomorrow you shall onlydo me a very trifling piece of work', 'Behind my house there is an olddry well into which my light has fallen it burns blue and never goesout and you shall bring it up again', 'Next day the old woman took himto the well and let him down in a basket', 'He found the blue light andmade her a signal to draw him up again', 'She did draw him up but when hecame near the edge she stretched down her hand and wanted to take theblue light away from him', 'No said he perceiving her evil intentionI will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet uponthe ground', 'The witch fell into a passion let him fall again into thewell and went away.The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground and the bluelight went on burning but of what use was that to him He saw very wellthat he could not escape death', 'He sat for a while very sorrowfullythen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe whichwas still half full', 'This shall be my last pleasure thought hepulled it out lit it at the blue light and began to smoke', 'When thesmoke had circled about the cavern suddenly a little black dwarf stoodbefore him and said Lord what are your commands What my commandsare replied the soldier quite astonished', 'I must do everything youbid me said the little man', 'Good said the soldier then in thefirst place help me out of this well', 'The little man took him by thehand and led him through an underground passage but he did not forgetto take the blue light with him', 'On the way the dwarf showed him thetreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there and thesoldier took as much gold as he could carry', 'When he was above he saidto the little man Now go and bind the old witch and carry her beforethe judge', 'In a short time she came by like the wind riding on a wildtomcat and screaming frightfully', 'Nor was it long before the little manreappeared', 'It is all done said he and the witch is already hangingon the gallows', 'What further commands has my lord inquired the dwarf.At this moment none answered the soldier you can return home onlybe at hand immediately if I summon you', 'Nothing more is needed thanthat you should light your pipe at the blue light and I will appearbefore you at once', 'Thereupon he vanished from his sight.The soldier returned to the town from which he came', 'He went to thebest inn ordered himself handsome clothes and then bade the landlordfurnish him a room as handsome as possible', 'When it was ready and thesoldier had taken possession of it he summoned the little black manikinand said I have served the king faithfully but he has dismissed meand left me to hunger and now I want to take my revenge', 'What am I todo asked the little man', 'Late at night when the kings daughter isin bed bring her here in her sleep she shall do servants work forme', 'The manikin said That is an easy thing for me to do but a verydangerous thing for you for if it is discovered you will fare ill.When twelve oclock had struck the door sprang open and the manikincarried in the princess', 'Aha are you there cried the soldier getto your work at once Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber', 'Whenshe had done this he ordered her to come to his chair and then hestretched out his feet and said Pull off my boots and then hethrew them in her face and made her pick them up again and cleanand brighten them', 'She however did everything he bade her withoutopposition silently and with halfshut eyes', 'When the first cockcrowed the manikin carried her back to the royal palace and laid herin her bed.Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father and toldhim that she had had a very strange dream', 'I was carried through thestreets with the rapidity of lightning said she and taken into asoldiers room and I had to wait upon him like a servant sweep hisroom clean his boots and do all kinds of menial work', 'It was only adream and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.The dream may have been true said the king', 'I will give you a pieceof advice', 'Fill your pocket full of peas and make a small hole in thepocket and then if you are carried away again they will fall out andleave a track in the streets', 'But unseen by the king the manikin wasstanding beside him when he said that and heard all', 'At night whenthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets some peascertainly did fall out of her pocket but they made no track for thecrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street therewas', 'And again the princess was compelled to do servants work untilcockcrow.Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track but it wasall in vain for in every street poor children were sitting picking uppeas and saying It must have rained peas last night', 'We must thinkof something else said the king keep your shoes on when you go tobed and before you come back from the place where you are taken hideone of them there I will soon contrive to find it', 'The black manikinheard this plot and at night when the soldier again ordered him tobring the princess revealed it to him and told him that he knew of noexpedient to counteract this stratagem and that if the shoe were foundin the soldiers house it would go badly with him', 'Do what I bid youreplied the soldier and again this third night the princess was obligedto work like a servant but before she went away she hid her shoe underthe bed.Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughtersshoe', 'It was found at the soldiers and the soldier himself who at theentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate was soon brought backand thrown into prison', 'In his flight he had forgotten the most valuablethings he had the blue light and the gold and had only one ducat inhis pocket', 'And now loaded with chains he was standing at the window ofhis dungeon when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by', 'Thesoldier tapped at the pane of glass and when this man came up said tohim Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying inthe inn and I will give you a ducat for doing it', 'His comrade ranthither and brought him what he wanted', 'As soon as the soldier was aloneagain he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin', 'Have nofear said the latter to his master', 'Go wheresoever they take you andlet them do what they will only take the blue light with you', 'Next daythe soldier was tried and though he had done nothing wicked the judgecondemned him to death', 'When he was led forth to die he begged a lastfavour of the king', 'What is it asked the king', 'That I may smoke onemore pipe on my way', 'You may smoke three answered the king but donot imagine that I will spare your life', 'Then the soldier pulled outhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light and as soon as a few wreathsof smoke had ascended the manikin was there with a small cudgel in hishand and said What does my lord command Strike down to earth thatfalse judge there and his constable and spare not the king who hastreated me so ill', 'Then the manikin fell on them like lightningdarting this way and that way and whosoever was so much as touched byhis cudgel fell to earth and did not venture to stir again', 'The kingwas terrified he threw himself on the soldiers mercy and merely tobe allowed to live at all gave him his kingdom for his own and hisdaughter to wife.THE RAVENThere was once a queen who had a little daughter still too young to runalone', 'One day the child was very troublesome and the mother could notquiet it do what she would', 'She grew impatient and seeing the ravensflying round the castle she opened the window and said I wish youwere a raven and would fly away then I should have a little peace.Scarcely were the words out of her mouth when the child in her arms wasturned into a raven and flew away from her through the open window', 'Thebird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long timeand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.Long after this a man was making his way through the wood when he hearda raven calling and he followed the sound of the voice', 'As he drewnear the raven said I am by birth a kings daughter but am now underthe spell of some enchantment you can however set me free', 'Whatam I to do he asked', 'She replied Go farther into the wood until youcome to a house wherein lives an old woman she will offer you food anddrink but you must not take of either if you do you will fall intoa deep sleep and will not be able to help me', 'In the garden behind thehouse is a large tanheap and on that you must stand and watch for me.I shall drive there in my carriage at two oclock in the afternoon forthree successive days the first day it will be drawn by four white thesecond by four chestnut and the last by four black horses but if youfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping I shall not be set free.The man promised to do all that she wished but the raven said Alas Iknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unableto save me', 'The man assured her again that he would on no account toucha thing to eat or drink.When he came to the house and went inside the old woman met him andsaid Poor man how tired you are Come in and rest and let me give yousomething to eat and drink.No answered the man I will neither eat not drink.But she would not leave him alone and urged him saying If you willnot eat anything at least you might take a draught of wine one drinkcounts for nothing and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded anddrank.As it drew towards the appointed hour he went outside into the gardenand mounted the tanheap to await the raven', 'Suddenly a feeling offatigue came over him and unable to resist it he lay down for a littlewhile fully determined however to keep awake but in another minutehis eyes closed of their own accord and he fell into such a deep sleepthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him', 'At twooclock the raven came driving along drawn by her four white horsesbut even before she reached the spot she said to herself sighing Iknow he has fallen asleep', 'When she entered the garden there she foundhim as she had feared lying on the tanheap fast asleep', 'She got outof her carriage and went to him she called him and shook him but itwas all in vain he still continued sleeping.The next day at noon the old woman came to him again with food anddrink which he at first refused', 'At last overcome by her persistententreaties that he would take something he lifted the glass and drankagain.Towards two oclock he went into the garden and on to the tanheap towatch for the raven', 'He had not been there long before he began to feelso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him and he couldnot stand upright any longer so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses she said sorrowfullyto herself I know he has fallen asleep', 'She went as before to lookfor him but he slept and it was impossible to awaken him.The following day the old woman said to him What is this You are noteating or drinking anything do you want to kill yourselfHe answered I may not and will not either eat or drink.But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of himand when he smelt the wine he was unable to resist the temptation andtook a deep draught.When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tanheap inthe garden to await the kings daughter but he felt even more overcomewith weariness than on the two previous days and throwing himself downhe slept like a log', 'At two oclock the raven could be seen approachingand this time her coachman and everything about her as well as herhorses were black.She was sadder than ever as she drove along and said mournfully Iknow he has fallen asleep and will not be able to set me free', 'Shefound him sleeping heavily and all her efforts to awaken him were of noavail', 'Then she placed beside him a loaf and some meat and a flaskof wine of such a kind that however much he took of them they wouldnever grow less', 'After that she drew a gold ring on which her name wasengraved off her finger and put it upon one of his', 'Finally she laida letter near him in which after giving him particulars of the foodand drink she had left for him she finished with the following wordsI see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set mefree if however you still wish to do so come to the golden castleof Stromberg this is well within your power to accomplish', 'She thenreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping he was grievedat heart and said She has no doubt been here and driven away againand it is now too late for me to save her', 'Then his eyes fell on thethings which were lying beside him he read the letter and knew from itall that had happened', 'He rose up without delay eager to start on hisway and to reach the castle of Stromberg but he had no idea in whichdirection he ought to go', 'He travelled about a long time in search of itand came at last to a dark forest through which he went on walking forfourteen days and still could not find a way out', 'Once more the nightcame on and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep', 'Againthe next day he pursued his way through the forest and that eveningthinking to rest again he lay down as before but he heard such ahowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep', 'He waited tillit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses and thenseeing a little glimmer ahead of him he went towards it.He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller thanit really was from the contrast of its height with that of an immensegiant who stood in front of it', 'He thought to himself If the giantsees me going in my life will not be worth much', 'However after awhile he summoned up courage and went forward', 'When the giant saw himhe called out It is lucky for that you have come for I have not hadanything to eat for a long time', 'I can have you now for my supper', 'Iwould rather you let that alone said the man for I do not willinglygive myself up to be eaten if you are wanting food I have enough tosatisfy your hunger', 'If that is so replied the giant I will leaveyou in peace I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.So they went indoors together and sat down and the man brought out thebread meat and wine which although he had eaten and drunk of themwere still unconsumed', 'The giant was pleased with the good cheer andate and drank to his hearts content', 'When he had finished his supperthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.The giant said I will look on my map on it are marked all the townsvillages and houses', 'So he fetched his map and looked for the castlebut could not find it', 'Never mind he said I have larger mapsupstairs in the cupboard we will look on those but they searched invain for the castle was not marked even on these', 'The man now thoughthe should like to continue his journey but the giant begged him toremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother who wasaway in search of provisions', 'When the brother came home they asked himabout the castle of Stromberg and he told them he would look on his ownmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger', 'Accordingly whenhe had finished his supper they all went up together to his room andlooked through his maps but the castle was not to be found', 'Then hefetched other older maps and they went on looking for the castle untilat last they found it but it was many thousand miles away', 'How shall Ibe able to get there asked the man', 'I have two hours to spare saidthe giant and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle Imust then return to look after the child who is in our care.The giant thereupon carried the man to within about a hundred leaguesof the castle where he left him saying You will be able to walk theremainder of the way yourself', 'The man journeyed on day and nighttill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg', 'He found it situatedhowever on a glass mountain and looking up from the foot he saw theenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside', 'He wasoverjoyed to see her and longed to get to the top of the mountain butthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb hefell back again', 'When he saw that it was impossible to reach her he wasgreatly grieved and said to himself I will remain here and wait forher so he built himself a little hut and there he sat and watched fora whole year and every day he saw the kings daughter driving round hercastle but still was unable to get nearer to her.Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and hecalled out to them God be with you', 'They stopped when they heard thecall but looking round and seeing nobody they went on again with theirfighting which now became more furious', 'God be with you he criedagain and again they paused and looked about but seeing no one wentback to their fighting', 'A third time he called out God be with youand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute betweenthe three men he went out and asked them why they were fighting soangrily with one another', 'One of them said that he had found a stickand that he had but to strike it against any door through which hewished to pass and it immediately flew open', 'Another told him that hehad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible and the third hadcaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle and evenup the glass mountain', 'They had been unable to decide whether theywould keep together and have the things in common or whether they wouldseparate', 'On hearing this the man said I will give you something inexchange for those three things not money for that I have not gotbut something that is of far more value', 'I must first however provewhether all you have told me about your three things is true', 'Therobbers therefore made him get on the horse and handed him the stickand the cloak and when he had put this round him he was no longervisible', 'Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one afteranother crying There you idle vagabonds you have got what youdeserve are you satisfied nowAfter this he rode up the glass mountain', 'When he reached the gate ofthe castle he found it closed but he gave it a blow with his stickand it flew wide open at once and he passed through', 'He mounted thesteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting with a goldengoblet full of wine in front of her', 'She could not see him for he stillwore his cloak', 'He took the ring which she had given him off his fingerand threw it into the goblet so that it rang as it touched the bottom.That is my own ring she exclaimed and if that is so the man mustalso be here who is coming to set me free.She sought for him about the castle but could find him nowhere.Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown offthe cloak', 'When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him andcried aloud for joy', 'Then he dismounted and took her in his arms andshe kissed him and said Now you have indeed set me free and tomorrowwe will celebrate our marriage.THE GOLDEN GOOSEThere was a man who had three sons the youngest of whom was calledDummling and was despised mocked and sneered at on every occasion.It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew woodand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and abottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.When he entered the forest he met a little greyhaired old man who badehim good day and said Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocketand let me have a draught of your wine I am so hungry and thirsty', 'Butthe clever son answered If I give you my cake and wine I shall havenone for myself be off with you and he left the little man standingand went on.But when he began to hew down a tree it was not long before he made afalse stroke and the axe cut him in the arm so that he had to go homeand have it bound up', 'And this was the little grey mans doing.After this the second son went into the forest and his mother gave himlike the eldest a cake and a bottle of wine', 'The little old grey manmet him likewise and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.But the second son too said sensibly enough What I give you will betaken away from myself be off and he left the little man standing andwent on', 'His punishment however was not delayed when he had made afew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg so that he had to becarried home.Then Dummling said Father do let me go and cut wood', 'The fatheranswered Your brothers have hurt themselves with it leave it aloneyou do not understand anything about it', 'But Dummling begged so longthat at last he said Just go then you will get wiser by hurtingyourself', 'His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in thecinders and with it a bottle of sour beer.When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewiseand greeting him said Give me a piece of your cake and a drink outof your bottle I am so hungry and thirsty', 'Dummling answered I haveonly cindercake and sour beer if that pleases you we will sitdown and eat', 'So they sat down and when Dummling pulled out hiscindercake it was a fine sweet cake and the sour beer had become goodwine', 'So they ate and drank and after that the little man said Sinceyou have a good heart and are willing to divide what you have I willgive you good luck', 'There stands an old tree cut it down and you willfind something at the roots', 'Then the little man took leave of him.Dummling went and cut down the tree and when it fell there was a goosesitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold', 'He lifted her up andtaking her with him went to an inn where he thought he would stay thenight', 'Now the host had three daughters who saw the goose and werecurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be and would haveliked to have one of its golden feathers.The eldest thought I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out afeather and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose bythe wing but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.The second came soon afterwards thinking only of how she might get afeather for herself but she had scarcely touched her sister than shewas held fast.At last the third also came with the like intent and the othersscreamed out Keep away for goodness sake keep away But she didnot understand why she was to keep away', 'The others are there shethought I may as well be there too and ran to them but as soon asshe had touched her sister she remained sticking fast to her', 'So theyhad to spend the night with the goose.The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set outwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on toit', 'They were obliged to run after him continually now left now rightwherever his legs took him.In the middle of the fields the parson met them and when he saw theprocession he said For shame you goodfornothing girls why are yourunning across the fields after this young man Is that seemly At thesame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her awaybut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast and was himselfobliged to run behind.Before long the sexton came by and saw his master the parson runningbehind three girls', 'He was astonished at this and called out Hiyour reverence whither away so quickly Do not forget that we have achristening today and running after him he took him by the sleeve butwas also held fast to it.Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other two labourerscame with their hoes from the fields the parson called out to themand begged that they would set him and the sexton free', 'But they hadscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast and now there wereseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.Soon afterwards he came to a city where a king ruled who had a daughterwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh', 'So he had put fortha decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marryher', 'When Dummling heard this he went with his goose and all her trainbefore the kings daughter and as soon as she saw the seven peoplerunning on and on one behind the other she began to laugh quiteloudly and as if she would never stop', 'Thereupon Dummling asked to haveher for his wife but the king did not like the soninlaw and made allmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drinka cellarful of wine', 'Dummling thought of the little grey man who couldcertainly help him so he went into the forest and in the same placewhere he had felled the tree he saw a man sitting who had a verysorrowful face', 'Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart sosorely and he answered I have such a great thirst and cannot quenchit cold water I cannot stand a barrel of wine I have just emptied butthat to me is like a drop on a hot stoneThere I can help you said Dummling just come with me and you shallbe satisfied.He led him into the kings cellar and the man bent over the hugebarrels and drank and drank till his loins hurt and before the day wasout he had emptied all the barrels', 'Then Dummling asked once morefor his bride but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow whomeveryone called Dummling should take away his daughter and he made anew condition he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountainof bread', 'Dummling did not think long but went straight into theforest where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up hisbody with a strap and making an awful face and saying I have eaten awhole ovenful of rolls but what good is that when one has such a hungeras I My stomach remains empty and I must tie myself up if I am not todie of hunger.At this Dummling was glad and said Get up and come with me you shalleat yourself full', 'He led him to the kings palace where all theflour in the whole Kingdom was collected and from it he caused a hugemountain of bread to be baked', 'The man from the forest stood before itbegan to eat and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride but the king againsought a way out and ordered a ship which could sail on land and onwater', 'As soon as you come sailing back in it said he you shallhave my daughter for wife.Dummling went straight into the forest and there sat the little greyman to whom he had given his cake', 'When he heard what Dummling wantedhe said Since you have given me to eat and to drink I will give youthe ship and I do all this because you once were kind to me', 'Then hegave him the ship which could sail on land and water and when the kingsaw that he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter', 'Thewedding was celebrated and after the kings death Dummling inheritedhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife', '     SimpletonTHE WATER OF LIFELong before you or I were born there reigned in a country a great wayoff a king who had three sons', 'This king once fell very illso illthat nobody thought he could live', 'His sons were very much grievedat their fathers sickness and as they were walking together verymournfully in the garden of the palace a little old man met them andasked what was the matter', 'They told him that their father was very illand that they were afraid nothing could save him', 'I know what wouldsaid the little old man it is the Water of Life', 'If he could have adraught of it he would be well again but it is very hard to get', 'Thenthe eldest son said I will soon find it and he went to the sickking and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life asit was the only thing that could save him', 'No said the king', 'I hadrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with inyour journey', 'But he begged so hard that the king let him go and theprince thought to himself If I bring my father this water he willmake me sole heir to his kingdom.Then he set out and when he had gone on his way some time he came to adeep valley overhung with rocks and woods and as he looked around hesaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf with asugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak and the dwarf called to him and saidPrince whither so fast What is that to thee you ugly imp saidthe prince haughtily and rode on.But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour and laid a fairy spellof illluck upon him so that as he rode on the mountain pass becamenarrower and narrower and at last the way was so straitened that hecould not go to step forward and when he thought to have turned hishorse round and go back the way he came he heard a loud laugh ringinground him and found that the path was closed behind him so that he wasshut in all round', 'He next tried to get off his horse and make his wayon foot but again the laugh rang in his ears and he found himselfunable to move a step and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his sonsreturn till at last the second son said Father I will go in searchof the Water of Life', 'For he thought to himself My brother is surelydead and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water', 'The king wasat first very unwilling to let him go but at last yielded to his wish.So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had doneand met with the same elf who stopped him at the same spot in themountains saying as before Prince prince whither so fast Mindyour own affairs busybody said the prince scornfully and rode on.But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elderbrother and he too was at last obliged to take up his abode in theheart of the mountains', 'Thus it is with proud silly people who thinkthemselves above everyone else and are too proud to ask or take advice.When the second prince had thus been gone a long time the youngest sonsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life and trusted he shouldsoon be able to make his father well again', 'So he set out and the dwarfmet him too at the same spot in the valley among the mountains andsaid Prince whither so fast And the prince said I am going insearch of the Water of Life because my father is ill and like to diecan you help me Pray be kind and aid me if you can Do you knowwhere it is to be found asked the dwarf', 'No said the prince I donot', 'Pray tell me if you know', 'Then as you have spoken to me kindlyand are wise enough to seek for advice I will tell you how and where togo', 'The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle andthat you may be able to reach it in safety I will give you an iron wandand two little loaves of bread strike the iron door of the castle threetimes with the wand and it will open two hungry lions will be lyingdown inside gaping for their prey but if you throw them the bread theywill let you pass then hasten on to the well and take some of theWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve for if you tarry longerthe door will shut upon you for ever.Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for hisfriendly aid and took the wand and the bread and went travelling onand on over sea and over land till he came to his journeys end andfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him', 'The door flew open atthe third stroke of the wand and when the lions were quieted he went onthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall', 'Around it hesaw several knights sitting in a trance then he pulled off their ringsand put them on his own fingers', 'In another room he saw on a table asword and a loaf of bread which he also took', 'Further on he came to aroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch and she welcomed himjoyfully and said if he would set her free from the spell that boundher the kingdom should be his if he would come back in a year andmarry her', 'Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Lifewas in the palace gardens and bade him make haste and draw what hewanted before the clock struck twelve.He walked on and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to adelightful shady spot in which stood a couch and he thought to himselfas he felt tired that he would rest himself for a while and gaze onthe lovely scenes around him', 'So he laid himself down and sleepfell upon him unawares so that he did not wake up till the clock wasstriking a quarter to twelve', 'Then he sprang from the couch dreadfullyfrightened ran to the well filled a cup that was standing by him fullof water and hastened to get away in time', 'Just as he was going out ofthe iron door it struck twelve and the door fell so quickly upon himthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.When he found himself safe he was overjoyed to think that he had gotthe Water of Life and as he was going on his way homewards he passedby the little dwarf who when he saw the sword and the loaf said Youhave made a noble prize with the sword you can at a blow slay wholearmies and the bread will never fail you', 'Then the prince thoughtto himself I cannot go home to my father without my brothers so hesaid My dear friend cannot you tell me where my two brothers are whoset out in search of the Water of Life before me and never came backI have shut them up by a charm between two mountains said the dwarfbecause they were proud and illbehaved and scorned to ask advice.The prince begged so hard for his brothers that the dwarf at last setthem free though unwillingly saying Beware of them for they havebad hearts', 'Their brother however was greatly rejoiced to see themand told them all that had happened to him how he had found the Waterof Life and had taken a cup full of it and how he had set a beautifulprincess free from a spell that bound her and how she had engaged towait a whole year and then to marry him and to give him the kingdom.Then they all three rode on together and on their way home came to acountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine so that it wasfeared all must die for want', 'But the prince gave the king of the landthe bread and all his kingdom ate of it', 'And he lent the king thewonderful sword and he slew the enemys army with it and thus thekingdom was once more in peace and plenty', 'In the same manner hebefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.When they came to the sea they got into a ship and during their voyagethe two eldest said to themselves Our brother has got the water whichwe could not find therefore our father will forsake us and give him thekingdom which is our right so they were full of envy and revenge andagreed together how they could ruin him', 'Then they waited till he wasfast asleep and poured the Water of Life out of the cup and took itfor themselves giving him bitter seawater instead.When they came to their journeys end the youngest son brought his cupto the sick king that he might drink and be healed', 'Scarcely howeverhad he tasted the bitter seawater when he became worse even than he wasbefore and then both the elder sons came in and blamed the youngestfor what they had done and said that he wanted to poison their fatherbut that they had found the Water of Life and had brought it with them.He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him than he felt hissickness leave him and was as strong and well as in his younger days.Then they went to their brother and laughed at him and said Wellbrother you found the Water of Life did you You have had the troubleand we shall have the reward', 'Pray with all your cleverness why didnot you manage to keep your eyes open Next year one of us will takeaway your beautiful princess if you do not take care', 'You had bettersay nothing about this to our father for he does not believe a word yousay and if you tell tales you shall lose your life into the bargainbut be quiet and we will let you off.The old king was still very angry with his youngest son and thoughtthat he really meant to have taken away his life so he called his courttogether and asked what should be done and all agreed that he ought tobe put to death', 'The prince knew nothing of what was going on till oneday when the kings chief huntsmen went ahunting with him and theywere alone in the wood together the huntsman looked so sorrowful thatthe prince said My friend what is the matter with you I cannot anddare not tell you said he', 'But the prince begged very hard and saidOnly tell me what it is and do not think I shall be angry for I willforgive you', 'Alas said the huntsman the king has ordered me toshoot you', 'The prince started at this and said Let me live and Iwill change dresses with you you shall take my royal coat to show to myfather and do you give me your shabby one', 'With all my heart saidthe huntsman I am sure I shall be glad to save you for I could nothave shot you', 'Then he took the princes coat and gave him the shabbyone and went away through the wood.Some time after three grand embassies came to the old kings courtwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son nowall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his swordand loaf of bread in order to rid them of their enemy and feed theirpeople', 'This touched the old kings heart and he thought his son mightstill be guiltless and said to his court O that my son were stillalive how it grieves me that I had him killed He is still alivesaid the huntsman and I am glad that I had pity on him but let himgo in peace and brought home his royal coat', 'At this the king wasoverwhelmed with joy and made it known throughout all his kingdom thatif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer shouldcome back and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shininggold and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback and rodestraight up to the gate upon it was her true lover and that they mustlet him in but whoever rode on one side of it they must be sure wasnot the right one and that they must send him away at once.The time soon came when the eldest brother thought that he would makehaste to go to the princess and say that he was the one who had sether free and that he should have her for his wife and the kingdom withher', 'As he came before the palace and saw the golden road he stopped tolook at it and he thought to himself It is a pity to ride upon thisbeautiful road so he turned aside and rode on the righthand side ofit', 'But when he came to the gate the guards who had seen the roadhe took said to him he could not be what he said he was and must goabout his business.The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand and whenhe came to the golden road and his horse had set one foot upon ithe stopped to look at it and thought it very beautiful and said tohimself What a pity it is that anything should tread here Then hetoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it', 'But when he came tothe gate the guards said he was not the true prince and that he toomust go away about his business and away he went.Now when the full year was come round the third brother left the forestin which he had lain hid for fear of his fathers anger and set out insearch of his betrothed bride', 'So he journeyed on thinking of her allthe way and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road wasmade of but went with his horse straight over it and as he came to thegate it flew open and the princess welcomed him with joy and saidhe was her deliverer and should now be her husband and lord of thekingdom', 'When the first joy at their meeting was over the princess toldhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him and of his wish tohave him home again so before his wedding with the princess he wentto visit his father taking her with him', 'Then he told him everythinghow his brothers had cheated and robbed him and yet that he had borneall those wrongs for the love of his father', 'And the old king was veryangry and wanted to punish his wicked sons but they made their escapeand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea and where theywent to nobody knew and nobody cared.And now the old king gathered together his court and asked all hiskingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.And young and old noble and squire gentle and simple came at onceon the summons and among the rest came the friendly dwarf with thesugarloaf hat and a new scarlet cloak', ' And the wedding was held and the merry bells run', ' And all the good people they danced and they sung  And feasted and frolickd I cant tell how long.THE TWELVE HUNTSMENThere was once a kings son who had a bride whom he loved very much', 'Andwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy news came that his fatherlay sick unto death and desired to see him once again before his end.Then he said to his beloved I must now go and leave you I give youa ring as a remembrance of me', 'When I am king I will return and fetchyou', 'So he rode away and when he reached his father the latter wasdangerously ill and near his death', 'He said to him Dear son I wishedto see you once again before my end promise me to marry as I wish andhe named a certain kings daughter who was to be his wife', 'The son wasin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing and said Yesdear father your will shall be done and thereupon the king shut hiseyes and died.When therefore the son had been proclaimed king and the time ofmourning was over he was forced to keep the promise which he had givenhis father and caused the kings daughter to be asked in marriage andshe was promised to him', 'His first betrothed heard of this and frettedso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died', 'Then her fathersaid to her Dearest child why are you so sad You shall havewhatsoever you will', 'She thought for a moment and said Dear fatherI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face figure and size.The father said If it be possible your desire shall be fulfilledand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom until elevenyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in facefigure and size.When they came to the kings daughter she had twelve suits ofhuntsmens clothes made all alike and the eleven maidens had to puton the huntsmens clothes and she herself put on the twelfth suit.Thereupon she took her leave of her father and rode away with themand rode to the court of her former betrothed whom she loved so dearly.Then she asked if he required any huntsmen and if he would take all ofthem into his service', 'The king looked at her and did not know her butas they were such handsome fellows he said Yes and that he wouldwillingly take them and now they were the kings twelve huntsmen.The king however had a lion which was a wondrous animal for he knewall concealed and secret things', 'It came to pass that one evening hesaid to the king You think you have twelve huntsmen Yes said theking they are twelve huntsmen', 'The lion continued You are mistakenthey are twelve girls', 'The king said That cannot be true Howwill you prove that to me Oh just let some peas be strewn in theantechamber answered the lion and then you will soon see', 'Men havea firm step and when they walk over peas none of them stir but girlstrip and skip and drag their feet and the peas roll about', 'The kingwas well pleased with the counsel and caused the peas to be strewn.There was however a servant of the kings who favoured the huntsmenand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went tothem and repeated everything and said The lion wants to make the kingbelieve that you are girls', 'Then the kings daughter thanked him andsaid to her maidens Show some strength and step firmly on the peas.So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called beforehim and they came into the antechamber where the peas were lying theystepped so firmly on them and had such a strong sure walk that notone of the peas either rolled or stirred', 'Then they went away againand the king said to the lion You have lied to me they walk just likemen', 'The lion said They have been informed that they were going tobe put to the test and have assumed some strength', 'Just let twelvespinningwheels be brought into the antechamber and they will go tothem and be pleased with them and that is what no man would do.The king liked the advice and had the spinningwheels placed in theantechamber.But the servant who was well disposed to the huntsmen went to themand disclosed the project', 'So when they were alone the kings daughtersaid to her eleven girls Show some constraint and do not look roundat the spinningwheels', 'And next morning when the king had his twelvehuntsmen summoned they went through the antechamber and never oncelooked at the spinningwheels', 'Then the king again said to the lionYou have deceived me they are men for they have not looked at thespinningwheels', 'The lion replied They have restrained themselves.The king however would no longer believe the lion.The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase and hisliking for them continually increased', 'Now it came to pass thatonce when they were out hunting news came that the kings bride wasapproaching', 'When the true bride heard that it hurt her so much thather heart was almost broken and she fell fainting to the ground', 'Theking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman ran up to himwanted to help him and drew his glove off', 'Then he saw the ring whichhe had given to his first bride and when he looked in her face herecognized her', 'Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her andwhen she opened her eyes he said You are mine and I am yours andno one in the world can alter that', 'He sent a messenger to the otherbride and entreated her to return to her own kingdom for he had a wifealready and someone who had just found an old key did not require a newone', 'Thereupon the wedding was celebrated and the lion was again takeninto favour because after all he had told the truth.THE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAINThere was once a merchant who had only one child a son that was veryyoung and barely able to run alone', 'He had two richly laden ships thenmaking a voyage upon the seas in which he had embarked all his wealthin the hope of making great gains when the news came that both werelost', 'Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor thatnothing was left to him but one small plot of land and there he oftenwent in an evening to take his walk and ease his mind of a little ofhis trouble.One day as he was roaming along in a brown study thinking with nogreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was and was liketo be all on a sudden there stood before him a little roughlookingblack dwarf', 'Prithee friend why so sorrowful said he to themerchant what is it you take so deeply to heart If you would do meany good I would willingly tell you said the merchant', 'Who knows butI may said the little man tell me what ails you and perhaps youwill find I may be of some use', 'Then the merchant told him how all hiswealth was gone to the bottom of the sea and how he had nothing leftbut that little plot of land', 'Oh trouble not yourself about thatsaid the dwarf only undertake to bring me here twelve years hencewhatever meets you first on your going home and I will give you as muchas you please', 'The merchant thought this was no great thing to askthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat or something of thatsort but forgot his little boy Heinel so he agreed to the bargain andsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.But as he drew near home his little boy was so glad to see him that hecrept behind him and laid fast hold of his legs and looked up inhis face and laughed', 'Then the father started trembling with fear andhorror and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do but as nogold was come he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a jokethat the dwarf was playing him and that at any rate when the moneycame he should see the bearer and would not take it in.About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumberroom to lookfor some old iron that he might sell it and raise a little money andthere instead of his iron he saw a large pile of gold lying on thefloor', 'At the sight of this he was overjoyed and forgetting all abouthis son went into trade again and became a richer merchant thanbefore.Meantime little Heinel grew up and as the end of the twelve years drewnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond and became very sadand thoughtful so that care and sorrow were written upon his face', 'Theboy one day asked what was the matter but his father would not tell forsome time at last however he said that he had without knowing itsold him for gold to a little uglylooking black dwarf and that thetwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word', 'Then Heinelsaid Father give yourself very little trouble about that I shall betoo much for the little man.When the time came the father and son went out together to the placeagreed upon and the son drew a circle on the ground and set himselfand his father in the middle of it', 'The little black dwarf soon cameand walked round and round about the circle but could not find any wayto get into it and he either could not or dared not jump over it', 'Atlast the boy said to him', 'Have you anything to say to us my friend orwhat do you want Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy thatwas fond of him and had told him what to do for this fairy knew whatgood luck was in store for him', 'Have you brought me what you said youwould said the dwarf to the merchant', 'The old man held his tongue butHeinel said again What do you want here The dwarf said I come totalk with your father not with you', 'You have cheated and taken in myfather said the son pray give him up his bond at once', 'Fair andsoftly said the little old man right is right I have paid my moneyand your father has had it and spent it so be so good as to let mehave what I paid it for', 'You must have my consent to that first saidHeinel so please to step in here and let us talk it over', 'The oldman grinned and showed his teeth as if he should have been very gladto get into the circle if he could', 'Then at last after a long talkthey came to terms', 'Heinel agreed that his father must give him up andthat so far the dwarf should have his way but on the other hand thefairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him if he followedhis own course and he did not choose to be given up to his humpbackedfriend who seemed so anxious for his company.So to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter it was settled thatHeinel should be put into an open boat that lay on the seashore hardby that the father should push him off with his own hand and that heshould thus be set adrift and left to the bad or good luck of wind andweather', 'Then he took leave of his father and set himself in the boatbut before it got far off a wave struck it and it fell with one sidelow in the water so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost andwent home very sorrowful while the dwarf went his way thinking that atany rate he had had his revenge.The boat however did not sink for the good fairy took care of herfriend and soon raised the boat up again and it went safely on', 'Theyoung man sat safe within till at length it ran ashore upon an unknownland', 'As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castlebut empty and dreary within for it was enchanted', 'Here said he tohimself must I find the prize the good fairy told me of', 'So he oncemore searched the whole palace through till at last he found a whitesnake lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.Now the white snake was an enchanted princess and she was very gladto see him and said Are you at last come to set me free Twelvelong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as shepromised for you alone can save me', 'This night twelve men will cometheir faces will be black and they will be dressed in chain armour.They will ask what you do here but give no answer and let them dowhat they willbeat whip pinch prick or torment youbear all onlyspeak not a word and at twelve oclock they must go away', 'The secondnight twelve others will come and the third night twentyfour whowill even cut off your head but at the twelfth hour of that night theirpower is gone and I shall be free and will come and bring you theWater of Life and will wash you with it and bring you back to lifeand health', 'And all came to pass as she had said Heinel bore all andspoke not a word and the third night the princess came and fell on hisneck and kissed him', 'Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castlethe wedding was celebrated and he was crowned king of the GoldenMountain.They lived together very happily and the queen had a son', 'And thuseight years had passed over their heads when the king thought of hisfather and he began to long to see him once again', 'But the queen wasagainst his going and said I know well that misfortunes will comeupon us if you go', 'However he gave her no rest till she agreed', 'At hisgoing away she gave him a wishingring and said Take this ring andput it on your finger whatever you wish it will bring you only promisenever to make use of it to bring me hence to your fathers house', 'Thenhe said he would do what she asked and put the ring on his finger andwished himself near the town where his father lived.Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment but the guards wouldnot let him go in because he was so strangely clad', 'So he went up to aneighbouring hill where a shepherd dwelt and borrowed his old frockand thus passed unknown into the town', 'When he came to his fathershouse he said he was his son but the merchant would not believe himand said he had had but one son his poor Heinel who he knew was longsince dead and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd he wouldnot even give him anything to eat', 'The king however still vowed thathe was his son and said Is there no mark by which you would know meif I am really your son Yes said his mother our Heinel had a marklike a raspberry on his right arm', 'Then he showed them the mark andthey knew that what he had said was true.He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain and wasmarried to a princess and had a son seven years old', 'But the merchantsaid that can never be true he must be a fine king truly who travelsabout in a shepherds frock At this the son was vexed and forgettinghis word turned his ring and wished for his queen and son', 'In aninstant they stood before him but the queen wept and said he hadbroken his word and bad luck would follow', 'He did all he could tosoothe her and she at last seemed to be appeased but she was not so intruth and was only thinking how she should punish him.One day he took her to walk with him out of the town and showed herthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters', 'Then he sathimself down and said I am very much tired sit by me I will rest myhead in your lap and sleep a while', 'As soon as he had fallen asleephowever she drew the ring from his finger and crept softly away andwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom', 'And when he awokehe found himself alone and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.I can never go back to my fathers house said he they would say Iam a sorcerer I will journey forth into the world till I come again tomy kingdom.So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill where threegiants were sharing their fathers goods and as they saw him pass theycried out and said Little men have sharp wits he shall part the goodsbetween us', 'Now there was a sword that cut off an enemys head wheneverthe wearer gave the words Heads off a cloak that made the ownerinvisible or gave him any form he pleased and a pair of boots thatcarried the wearer wherever he wished', 'Heinel said they must first lethim try these wonderful things then he might know how to set a valueupon them', 'Then they gave him the cloak and he wished himself a flyand in a moment he was a fly', 'The cloak is very well said he nowgive me the sword', 'No said they not unless you undertake not tosay Heads off for if you do we are all dead men', 'So they gave ithim charging him to try it on a tree', 'He next asked for the boots alsoand the moment he had all three in his power he wished himself atthe Golden Mountain and there he was at once', 'So the giants were leftbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music andthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry anotherhusband', 'Then he threw his cloak around him and passed through thecastle hall and placed himself by the side of the queen where no onesaw him', 'But when anything to eat was put upon her plate he took itaway and ate it himself and when a glass of wine was handed to her hetook it and drank it and thus though they kept on giving her meat anddrink her plate and cup were always empty.Upon this fear and remorse came over her and she went into her chamberalone and sat there weeping and he followed her there', 'Alas saidshe to herself was I not once set free Why then does this enchantmentstill seem to bind meFalse and fickle one said he', 'One indeed came who set thee free andhe is now near thee again but how have you used him Ought he tohave had such treatment from thee Then he went out and sent away thecompany and said the wedding was at an end for that he was come backto the kingdom', 'But the princes peers and great men mocked at him.However he would enter into no parley with them but only asked themif they would go in peace or not', 'Then they turned upon him and triedto seize him but he drew his sword', 'Heads Off cried he and with theword the traitors heads fell before him and Heinel was once more kingof the Golden Mountain.DOCTOR KNOWALLThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb who drove withtwo oxen a load of wood to the town and sold it to a doctor for twotalers', 'When the money was being counted out to him it so happened thatthe doctor was sitting at table and when the peasant saw how well heate and drank his heart desired what he saw and would willinglyhave been a doctor too', 'So he remained standing a while and at lengthinquired if he too could not be a doctor', 'Oh yes said the doctorthat is soon managed', 'What must I do asked the peasant', 'In thefirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock onthe frontispiece in the second turn your cart and your two oxen intomoney and get yourself some clothes and whatsoever else pertains tomedicine thirdly have a sign painted for yourself with the words Iam Doctor Knowall and have that nailed up above your housedoor', 'Thepeasant did everything that he had been told to do', 'When he had doctoredpeople awhile but not long a rich and great lord had some moneystolen', 'Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and sucha village and must know what had become of the money', 'So the lord hadthe horses harnessed to his carriage drove out to the village andasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall', 'Yes he was he said', 'Then he wasto go with him and bring back the stolen money', 'Oh yes but Grete mywife must go too', 'The lord was willing and let both of them have aseat in the carriage and they all drove away together', 'When they cameto the noblemans castle the table was spread and Crabb was told tosit down and eat', 'Yes but my wife Grete too said he and he seatedhimself with her at the table', 'And when the first servant came with adish of delicate fare the peasant nudged his wife and said Gretethat was the first meaning that was the servant who brought the firstdish', 'The servant however thought he intended by that to say That isthe first thief and as he actually was so he was terrified and saidto his comrade outside The doctor knows all we shall fare ill hesaid I was the first', 'The second did not want to go in at all but wasforced', 'So when he went in with his dish the peasant nudged his wifeand said Grete that is the second', 'This servant was equally alarmedand he got out as fast as he could', 'The third fared no better for thepeasant again said Grete that is the third', 'The fourth had to carryin a dish that was covered and the lord told the doctor that he was toshow his skill and guess what was beneath the cover', 'Actually therewere crabs', 'The doctor looked at the dish had no idea what to say andcried Ah poor Crabb', 'When the lord heard that he cried There heknows it he must also know who has the moneyOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy and made a sign to thedoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment', 'When thereforehe went out all four of them confessed to him that they had stolenthe money and said that they would willingly restore it and give him aheavy sum into the bargain if he would not denounce them for if hedid they would be hanged', 'They led him to the spot where the money wasconcealed', 'With this the doctor was satisfied and returned to the hallsat down to the table and said My lord now will I search in my bookwhere the gold is hidden', 'The fifth servant however crept into thestove to hear if the doctor knew still more', 'But the doctor sat stilland opened his A B C book turned the pages backwards and forwards andlooked for the cock', 'As he could not find it immediately he said Iknow you are there so you had better come out Then the fellow in thestove thought that the doctor meant him and full of terror sprang outcrying That man knows everything Then Doctor Knowall showed the lordwhere the money was but did not say who had stolen it and receivedfrom both sides much money in reward and became a renowned man.THE SEVEN RAVENSThere was once a man who had seven sons and last of all one daughter.Although the little girl was very pretty she was so weak and small thatthey thought she could not live but they said she should at once bechristened.So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get somewater but the other six ran with him', 'Each wanted to be first atdrawing the water and so they were in such a hurry that all let theirpitchers fall into the well and they stood very foolishly looking atone another and did not know what to do for none dared go home', 'In themeantime the father was uneasy and could not tell what made theyoung men stay so long', 'Surely said he the whole seven must haveforgotten themselves over some game of play and when he had waitedstill longer and they yet did not come he flew into a rage and wishedthem all turned into ravens', 'Scarcely had he spoken these words when heheard a croaking over his head and looked up and saw seven ravens asblack as coal flying round and round', 'Sorry as he was to see his wishso fulfilled he did not know how what was done could be undone andcomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sonswith his dear little daughter who soon became stronger and every daymore beautiful.For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers forher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her but oneday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them', 'Yes saidthey she is beautiful indeed but still tis a pity that her brothersshould have been lost for her sake', 'Then she was much grieved and wentto her father and mother and asked if she had any brothers and whathad become of them', 'So they dared no longer hide the truth from her butsaid it was the will of Heaven and that her birth was only the innocentcause of it but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day andthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers backand she had neither rest nor ease till at length one day she stoleaway and set out into the wide world to find her brothers whereverthey might be and free them whatever it might cost her.She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and motherhad given her a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry a littlepitcher of water in case she should be thirsty and a little stoolto rest upon when she should be weary', 'Thus she went on and on andjourneyed till she came to the worlds end then she came to the sunbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery so she ran away quickly tothe moon but the moon was cold and chilly and said I smell fleshand blood this way so she took herself away in a hurry and came to thestars and the stars were friendly and kind to her and each star satupon his own little stool but the morning star rose up and gave her alittle piece of wood and said If you have not this little piece ofwood you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glassmountainand there your brothers live', 'The little girl took the piece of woodrolled it up in a little cloth and went on again until she came to theglassmountain and found the door shut', 'Then she felt for the littlepiece of wood but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there andshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars', 'What was to be doneShe wanted to save her brothers and had no key of the castle of theglassmountain so this faithful little sister took a knife out of herpocket and cut off her little finger that was just the size of thepiece of wood she had lost and put it in the door and opened it.As she went in a little dwarf came up to her and said What are youseeking for I seek for my brothers the seven ravens answered she.Then the dwarf said My masters are not at home but if you will waittill they come pray step in', 'Now the little dwarf was getting theirdinner ready and he brought their food upon seven little plates andtheir drink in seven little glasses and set them upon the table andout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece and out of eachlittle glass she drank a small drop but she let the ring that she hadbrought with her fall into the last glass.On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air and thedwarf said Here come my masters', 'When they came in they wanted toeat and drink and looked for their little plates and glasses', 'Then saidone after the otherWho has eaten from my little plate And who has been drinking out of mylittle glass Caw Caw well I ween  Mortal lips have this way been.When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass and found there thering he looked at it and knew that it was his fathers and mothersand said O that our little sister would but come then we should befree', 'When the little girl heard this for she stood behind the doorall the time and listened she ran forward and in an instant allthe ravens took their right form again and all hugged and kissed eachother and went merrily home.THE WEDDING OF MRS FOXFIRST STORYThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails who believed thathis wife was not faithful to him and wished to put her to the test', 'Hestretched himself out under the bench did not move a limb and behavedas if he were stone dead', 'Mrs Fox went up to her room shut herself inand her maid Miss Cat sat by the fire and did the cooking', 'When itbecame known that the old fox was dead suitors presented

left off they are dancingstill.THE SALADAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a woodthere came up a little old woman and said to him Good day good dayyou seem merry enough but I am hungry and thirsty do pray give mesomething to eat', 'The huntsman took pity on her and put his hand inhis pocket and gave her what he had', 'Then he wanted to go his way butshe took hold of him and said Listen my friend to what I am goingto tell you I will reward you for your kindness go your way and aftera little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birdssitting on a cloak', 'Shoot into the midst of them and one will fall downdead the cloak will fall too take it it is a wishingcloak and whenyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish tobe', 'Cut open the dead bird take out its heart and keep it and you willfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise', 'Itis the birds heart that will bring you this good luck.The huntsman thanked her and thought to himself If all this doeshappen it will be a fine thing for me', 'When he had gone a hundredsteps or so he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over himand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their billsand feet screaming fighting and tugging at each other as ifeach wished to have it himself', 'Well said the huntsman this iswonderful this happens just as the old woman said then he shot intothe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about', 'Off went theflock chattering away but one fell down dead and the cloak with it.Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him cut open the bird tookout the heart and carried the cloak home with him.The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow and there laythe piece of gold glittering underneath the same happened next day andindeed every day when he arose', 'He heaped up a great deal of gold andat last thought to himself Of what use is this gold to me whilst I amat home I will go out into the world and look about me.Then he took leave of his friends and hung his bag and bow about hisneck and went his way', 'It so happened that his road one day led througha thick wood at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadowand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful younglady by her side looking about them', 'Now the old woman was a witch andsaid to the young lady There is a young man coming out of the wood whocarries a wonderful prize we must get it away from him my dear childfor it is more fit for us than for him', 'He has a birds heart thatbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning', 'Meantime thehuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady and said to himself Ihave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castleand rest myself for I have money enough to pay for anything I wantbut the real reason was that he wanted to see more of the beautifullady', 'Then he went into the house and was welcomed kindly and it wasnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing elsebut looking at the ladys eyes and doing everything that she wished.Then the old woman said Now is the time for getting the birds heart.So the lady stole it away and he never found any more gold under hispillow for it lay now under the young ladys and the old woman took itaway every morning but he was so much in love that he never missed hisprize.Well said the old witch we have got the birds heart but not thewishingcloak yet and that we must also get', 'Let us leave him thatsaid the young lady he has already lost his wealth', 'Then the witchwas very angry and said Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderfulthing and I must and will have it', 'So she did as the old woman toldher and set herself at the window and looked about the country andseemed very sorrowful then the huntsman said What makes you so sadAlas dear sir said she yonder lies the granite rock where all thecostly diamonds grow and I want so much to go there that whenever Ithink of it I cannot help being sorrowful for who can reach it onlythe birds and the fliesman cannot', 'If thats all your grief saidthe huntsman Ill take you there with all my heart so he drew her underhis cloak and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain theywere both there', 'The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they weredelighted with the sight and picked up the finest', 'But the old witchmade a deep sleep come upon him and he said to the young lady Let ussit down and rest ourselves a little I am so tired that I cannot standany longer', 'So they sat down and he laid his head in her lap andfell asleep and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak fromhis shoulders hung it on her own picked up the diamonds and wishedherself home again.When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him and left himalone on the wild rock he said Alas what roguery there is in theworld and there he sat in great grief and fear not knowing what todo', 'Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it and ashe saw three of them striding about he thought to himself I can onlysave myself by feigning to be asleep so he laid himself down as if hewere in a sound sleep', 'When the giants came up to him the first pushedhim with his foot and said What worm is this that lies here curledup Tread upon him and kill him said the second', 'Its not worth thetrouble said the third let him live hell go climbing higher up themountain and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away', 'And theypassed on', 'But the huntsman had heard all they said and as soon as theywere gone he climbed to the top of the mountain and when he had satthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him and caught him in awhirlwind and bore him along for some time till it settled in a gardenand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.Then he looked around him and said I wish I had something to eat ifnot I shall be worse off than before for here I see neither applesnor pears nor any kind of fruits nothing but vegetables', 'At last hethought to himself I can eat salad it will refresh and strengthenme', 'So he picked out a fine head and ate of it but scarcely had heswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed and saw withhorror that he was turned into an ass', 'However he still felt veryhungry and the salad tasted very nice so he ate on till he cameto another kind of salad and scarcely had he tasted it when he feltanother change come over him and soon saw that he was lucky enough tohave found his old shape again.Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness andwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good andthe bad salad and thought to himself This will help me to my fortuneagain and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery', 'So hewent away to try and find the castle of his friends and after wanderingabout a few days he luckily found it', 'Then he stained his face all overbrown so that even his mother would not have known him and went intothe castle and asked for a lodging I am so tired said he that Ican go no farther', 'Countryman said the witch who are you and whatis your business I am said he a messenger sent by the king tofind the finest salad that grows under the sun', 'I have been luckyenough to find it and have brought it with me but the heat of the sunscorches so that it begins to wither and I dont know that I can carryit farther.When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad theylonged to taste it and said Dear countryman let us just taste it.To be sure answered he I have two heads of it with me and willgive you one so he opened his bag and gave them the bad', 'Then thewitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed and when it wasready she could not wait till it was carried up but took a few leavesimmediately and put them in her mouth and scarcely were they swallowedwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in theform of an ass', 'Now the servantmaid came into the kitchen and seeingthe salad ready was going to carry it up but on the way she too felt awish to taste it as the old woman had done and ate some leaves so shealso was turned into an ass and ran after the other letting the dishwith the salad fall on the ground', 'The messenger sat all this time withthe beautiful young lady and as nobody came with the salad and shelonged to taste it she said I dont know where the salad can be.Then he thought something must have happened and said I will gointo the kitchen and see', 'And as he went he saw two asses in the courtrunning about and the salad lying on the ground', 'All right saidhe those two have had their share', 'Then he took up the rest ofthe leaves laid them on the dish and brought them to the young ladysaying I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.So she ate of it and like the others ran off into the court brayingaway.Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that theymight know him', 'Now you shall be paid for your roguery said he andtied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till hecame to a mill and knocked at the window', 'Whats the matter said themiller', 'I have three tiresome beasts here said the other if youwill take them give them food and room and treat them as I tell youI will pay you whatever you ask', 'With all my heart said the millerbut how shall I treat them Then the huntsman said Give the oldone stripes three times a day and hay once give the next who wasthe servantmaid stripes once a day and hay three times and givethe youngest who was the beautiful lady hay three times a day andno stripes for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.After this he went back to the castle where he found everything hewanted.Some days after the miller came to him and told him that the old asswas dead The other two said he are alive and eat but are sosorrowful that they cannot last long', 'Then the huntsman pitied themand told the miller to drive them back to him and when they came hegave them some of the good salad to eat', 'And the beautiful young ladyfell upon her knees before him and said O dearest huntsman forgiveme all the ill I have done you my mother forced me to it it wasagainst my will for I always loved you very much', 'Your wishingcloakhangs up in the closet and as for the birds heart I will give it youtoo', 'But he said Keep it it will be just the same thing for I meanto make you my wife', 'So they were married and lived together veryhappily till they died.THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WASA certain father had two sons the elder of who was smart and sensibleand could do everything but the younger was stupid and could neitherlearn nor understand anything and when people saw him they saidTheres a fellow who will give his father some trouble When anythinghad to be done it was always the elder who was forced to do it butif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late or in thenighttime and the way led through the churchyard or any other dismalplace he answered Oh no father Ill not go there it makes meshudder for he was afraid', 'Or when stories were told by the fire atnight which made the flesh creep the listeners sometimes said Ohit makes us shudder The younger sat in a corner and listened withthe rest of them and could not imagine what they could mean', 'They arealways saying It makes me shudder it makes me shudder It does notmake me shudder thought he', 'That too must be an art of which Iunderstand nothingNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day Hearken to meyou fellow in the corner there you are growing tall and strong and youtoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread', 'Look how yourbrother works but you do not even earn your salt', 'Well father hereplied I am quite willing to learn somethingindeed if it could butbe managed I should like to learn how to shudder', 'I dont understandthat at all yet', 'The elder brother smiled when he heard that andthought to himself Goodness what a blockhead that brother of mine isHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives He who wants tobe a sickle must bend himself betimes.The father sighed and answered him You shall soon learn what it is toshudder but you will not earn your bread by that.Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit and the fatherbewailed his trouble and told him how his younger son was so backwardin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing', 'Just thinksaid he when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread heactually wanted to learn to shudder', 'If that be all replied thesexton he can learn that with me', 'Send him to me and I will soonpolish him', 'The father was glad to do it for he thought It willtrain the boy a little', 'The sexton therefore took him into his houseand he had to ring the church bell', 'After a day or two the sexton awokehim at midnight and bade him arise and go up into the church tower andring the bell', 'You shall soon learn what shuddering is thought heand secretly went there before him and when the boy was at the top ofthe tower and turned round and was just going to take hold of the bellrope he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the soundinghole', 'Who is there cried he but the figure made no reply and didnot move or stir', 'Give an answer cried the boy or take yourselfoff you have no business here at night.The sexton however remained standing motionless that the boy mightthink he was a ghost', 'The boy cried a second time What do you wantherespeak if you are an honest fellow or I will throw you down thesteps The sexton thought He cant mean to be as bad as his wordsuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone', 'Then the boycalled to him for the third time and as that was also to no purposehe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs so that it felldown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner', 'Thereupon herang the bell went home and without saying a word went to bed andfell asleep', 'The sextons wife waited a long time for her husband buthe did not come back', 'At length she became uneasy and wakened the boyand asked Do you know where my husband is He climbed up the towerbefore you did', 'No I dont know replied the boy but someone wasstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps and as hewould neither give an answer nor go away I took him for a scoundreland threw him downstairs', 'Just go there and you will see if it was he.I should be sorry if it were', 'The woman ran away and found her husbandwho was lying moaning in the corner and had broken his leg.She carried him down and then with loud screams she hastened to theboys father Your boy cried she has been the cause of a greatmisfortune He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke hisleg', 'Take the goodfornothing fellow out of our house', 'The father wasterrified and ran thither and scolded the boy', 'What wicked tricksare these said he', 'The devil must have put them into your head.Father he replied do listen to me', 'I am quite innocent', 'He wasstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil', 'I did not knowwho it was and I entreated him three times either to speak or to goaway', 'Ah said the father I have nothing but unhappiness with you.Go out of my sight', 'I will see you no more.Yes father right willingly wait only until it is day', 'Then will Igo forth and learn how to shudder and then I shall at any rateunderstand one art which will support me', 'Learn what you will spokethe father it is all the same to me', 'Here are fifty talers for you.Take these and go into the wide world and tell no one from whence youcome and who is your father for I have reason to be ashamed of you.Yes father it shall be as you will', 'If you desire nothing more thanthat I can easily keep it in mind.When the day dawned therefore the boy put his fifty talers into hispocket and went forth on the great highway and continually said tohimself If I could but shudder If I could but shudder Then a manapproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding withhimself and when they had walked a little farther to where they couldsee the gallows the man said to him Look there is the tree whereseven men have married the ropemakers daughter and are now learninghow to fly', 'Sit down beneath it and wait till night comes and you willsoon learn how to shudder', 'If that is all that is wanted answeredthe youth it is easily done but if I learn how to shudder as fast asthat you shall have my fifty talers', 'Just come back to me early in themorning', 'Then the youth went to the gallows sat down beneath it andwaited till evening came', 'And as he was cold he lighted himself a firebut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire hecould not get warm', 'And as the wind knocked the hanged men against eachother and they moved backwards and forwards he thought to himselfIf you shiver below by the fire how those up above must freeze andsuffer And as he felt pity for them he raised the ladder and climbedup unbound one of them after the other and brought down all seven.Then he stoked the fire blew it and set them all round it to warmthemselves', 'But they sat there and did not stir and the fire caughttheir clothes', 'So he said Take care or I will hang you up again', 'Thedead men however did not hear but were quite silent and let theirrags go on burning', 'At this he grew angry and said If you will nottake care I cannot help you I will not be burnt with you and he hungthem up again each in his turn', 'Then he sat down by his fire and fellasleep and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to havethe fifty talers and said Well do you know how to shudder Noanswered he how should I know Those fellows up there did not opentheir mouths and were so stupid that they let the few old rags whichthey had on their bodies get burnt', 'Then the man saw that he would notget the fifty talers that day and went away saying Such a youth hasnever come my way before.The youth likewise went his way and once more began to mutter tohimself Ah if I could but shudder Ah if I could but shudder Awaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked Who areyou I dont know answered the youth', 'Then the waggoner asked Fromwhence do you come I know not', 'Who is your father That I maynot tell you', 'What is it that you are always muttering between yourteeth Ah replied the youth I do so wish I could shudder butno one can teach me how', 'Enough of your foolish chatter said thewaggoner', 'Come go with me I will see about a place for you', 'Theyouth went with the waggoner and in the evening they arrived at an innwhere they wished to pass the night', 'Then at the entrance of the parlourthe youth again said quite loudly If I could but shudder If I couldbut shudder The host who heard this laughed and said If that isyour desire there ought to be a good opportunity for you here', 'Ahbe silent said the hostess so many prying persons have already losttheir lives it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes asthese should never see the daylight again.But the youth said However difficult it may be I will learn it', 'Forthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth', 'He let the host haveno rest until the latter told him that not far from thence stood ahaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering wasif he would but watch in it for three nights', 'The king had promised thathe who would venture should have his daughter to wife and she was themost beautiful maiden the sun shone on', 'Likewise in the castle lay greattreasures which were guarded by evil spirits and these treasures wouldthen be freed and would make a poor man rich enough', 'Already many menhad gone into the castle but as yet none had come out again', 'Then theyouth went next morning to the king and said If it be allowed I willwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.The king looked at him and as the youth pleased him he said You mayask for three things to take into the castle with you but they mustbe things without life', 'Then he answered Then I ask for a fire aturning lathe and a cuttingboard with the knife.The king had these things carried into the castle for him during theday', 'When night was drawing near the youth went up and made himselfa bright fire in one of the rooms placed the cuttingboard and knifebeside it and seated himself by the turninglathe', 'Ah if I couldbut shudder said he but I shall not learn it here either', 'Towardsmidnight he was about to poke his fire and as he was blowing itsomething cried suddenly from one corner Au miau how cold we areYou fools cried he what are you crying about If you are cold comeand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves', 'And when he had saidthat two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat downon each side of him and looked savagely at him with their fieryeyes', 'After a short time when they had warmed themselves they saidComrade shall we have a game of cards Why not he replied butjust show me your paws', 'Then they stretched out their claws', 'Oh saidhe what long nails you have Wait I must first cut them for you.Thereupon he seized them by the throats put them on the cuttingboardand screwed their feet fast', 'I have looked at your fingers said heand my fancy for cardplaying has gone and he struck them dead andthrew them out into the water', 'But when he had made away with these twoand was about to sit down again by his fire out from every hole andcorner came black cats and black dogs with redhot chains and moreand more of them came until he could no longer move and they yelledhorribly and got on his fire pulled it to pieces and tried to putit out', 'He watched them for a while quietly but at last when they weregoing too far he seized his cuttingknife and cried Away with youvermin and began to cut them down', 'Some of them ran away the othershe killed and threw out into the fishpond', 'When he came back he fannedthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself', 'And as he thus sat hiseyes would keep open no longer and he felt a desire to sleep', 'Then helooked round and saw a great bed in the corner', 'That is the very thingfor me said he and got into it', 'When he was just going to shut hiseyes however the bed began to move of its own accord and went overthe whole of the castle', 'Thats right said he but go faster', 'Thenthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it up and downover thresholds and stairs but suddenly hop hop it turned over upsidedown and lay on him like a mountain', 'But he threw quilts and pillows upin the air got out and said Now anyone who likes may drive andlay down by his fire and slept till it was day', 'In the morning the kingcame and when he saw him lying there on the ground he thought the evilspirits had killed him and he was dead', 'Then said he After all it is apityfor so handsome a man', 'The youth heard it got up and said Ithas not come to that yet', 'Then the king was astonished but very gladand asked how he had fared', 'Very well indeed answered he onenight is past the two others will pass likewise', 'Then he went to theinnkeeper who opened his eyes very wide and said I never expected tosee you alive again Have you learnt how to shudder yet No said heit is all in vain', 'If someone would but tell meThe second night he again went up into the old castle sat down by thefire and once more began his old song If I could but shudder Whenmidnight came an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard atfirst it was low but it grew louder and louder', 'Then it was quiet fora while and at length with a loud scream half a man came down thechimney and fell before him', 'Hullo cried he another half belongsto this', 'This is not enough Then the uproar began again there was aroaring and howling and the other half fell down likewise', 'Wait saidhe I will just stoke up the fire a little for you', 'When he had donethat and looked round again the two pieces were joined together and ahideous man was sitting in his place', 'That is no part of our bargainsaid the youth the bench is mine', 'The man wanted to push him awaythe youth however would not allow that but thrust him off with allhis strength and seated himself again in his own place', 'Then still moremen fell down one after the other they brought nine dead mens legsand two skulls and set them up and played at ninepins with them', 'Theyouth also wanted to play and said Listen you can I join you Yesif you have any money', 'Money enough replied he but your balls arenot quite round', 'Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe andturned them till they were round', 'There now they will roll bettersaid he', 'Hurrah now well have fun He played with them and lost someof his money but when it struck twelve everything vanished from hissight', 'He lay down and quietly fell asleep', 'Next morning the king cameto inquire after him', 'How has it fared with you this time asked he.I have been playing at ninepins he answered and have lost a coupleof farthings', 'Have you not shuddered then What said he I havehad a wonderful time If I did but know what it was to shudderThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadlyIf I could but shudder', 'When it grew late six tall men came in andbrought a coffin', 'Then he said Ha ha that is certainly my littlecousin who died only a few days ago and he beckoned with his fingerand cried Come little cousin come', 'They placed the coffin on theground but he went to it and took the lid off and a dead man laytherein', 'He felt his face but it was cold as ice', 'Wait said he Iwill warm you a little and went to the fire and warmed his hand andlaid it on the dead mans face but he remained cold', 'Then he took himout and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed hisarms that the blood might circulate again', 'As this also did no good hethought to himself When two people lie in bed together they warm eachother and carried him to the bed covered him over and lay down byhim', 'After a short time the dead man became warm too and began to move.Then said the youth See little cousin have I not warmed you Thedead man however got up and cried Now will I strangle you.What said he is that the way you thank me You shall at once gointo your coffin again and he took him up threw him into it and shutthe lid', 'Then came the six men and carried him away again', 'I cannotmanage to shudder said he', 'I shall never learn it here as long as Ilive.Then a man entered who was taller than all others and looked terrible.He was old however and had a long white beard', 'You wretch cried heyou shall soon learn what it is to shudder for you shall die', 'Not sofast replied the youth', 'If I am to die I shall have to have a sayin it', 'I will soon seize you said the fiend', 'Softly softly do nottalk so big', 'I am as strong as you are and perhaps even stronger.We shall see said the old man', 'If you are stronger I will let yougocome we will try', 'Then he led him by dark passages to a smithsforge took an axe and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.I can do better than that said the youth and went to the otheranvil', 'The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on and hiswhite beard hung down', 'Then the youth seized the axe split the anvilwith one blow and in it caught the old mans beard', 'Now I have yousaid the youth', 'Now it is your turn to die', 'Then he seized an iron barand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop when hewould give him great riches', 'The youth drew out the axe and let him go.The old man led him back into the castle and in a cellar showed himthree chests full of gold', 'Of these said he one part is for thepoor the other for the king the third yours', 'In the meantime itstruck twelve and the spirit disappeared so that the youth stood indarkness', 'I shall still be able to find my way out said he and feltabout found the way into the room and slept there by his fire.Next morning the king came and said Now you must have learnt whatshuddering is No he answered what can it be My dead cousin washere and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money downbelow but no one told me what it was to shudder', 'Then said theking you have saved the castle and shall marry my daughter', 'Thatis all very well said he but still I do not know what it is toshudderThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated but howsoevermuch the young king loved his wife and however happy he was he stillsaid always If I could but shudderif I could but shudder', 'And thisat last angered her', 'Her waitingmaid said I will find a cure for himhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder', 'She went out to the streamwhich flowed through the garden and had a whole bucketful of gudgeonsbrought to her', 'At night when the young king was sleeping his wife wasto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold waterwith the gudgeons in it over him so that the little fishes wouldsprawl about him', 'Then he woke up and cried Oh what makes me shuddersowhat makes me shudder so dear wife Ah now I know what it is toshudderKING GRISLYBEARDA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was verybeautiful but so proud and haughty and conceited that none of theprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her and sheonly made sport of them.Once upon a time the king held a great feast and asked thither allher suitors and they all sat in a row ranged according to theirrankkings and princes and dukes and earls and counts and baronsand knights', 'Then the princess came in and as she passed by them shehad something spiteful to say to every one', 'The first was too fat Hesas round as a tub said she', 'The next was too tall What a maypolesaid she', 'The next was too short What a dumpling said she', 'Thefourth was too pale and she called him Wallface', 'The fifth was toored so she called him Coxcomb', 'The sixth was not straight enoughso she said he was like a green stick that had been laid to dry overa bakers oven', 'And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one butshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there', 'Look athim said she his beard is like an old mop he shall be calledGrislybeard', 'So the king got the nickname of Grislybeard.But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behavedand how she illtreated all his guests and he vowed that willing orunwilling she should marry the first man be he prince or beggar thatcame to the door.Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler who began to playunder the window and beg alms and when the king heard him he saidLet him come in', 'So they brought in a dirtylooking fellow and whenhe had sung before the king and the princess he begged a boon', 'Then theking said You have sung so well that I will give you my daughter foryour wife', 'The princess begged and prayed but the king said I havesworn to give you to the first comer and I will keep my word', 'So wordsand tears were of no avail the parson was sent for and she was marriedto the fiddler', 'When this was over the king said Now get ready togoyou must not stay hereyou must travel on with your husband.Then the fiddler went his way and took her with him and they soon cameto a great wood', 'Pray said she whose is this wood It belongsto King Grislybeard answered he hadst thou taken him all had beenthine', 'Ah unlucky wretch that I am sighed she would that I hadmarried King Grislybeard Next they came to some fine meadows', 'Whoseare these beautiful green meadows said she', 'They belong to KingGrislybeard hadst thou taken him they had all been thine', 'Ahunlucky wretch that I am said she would that I had married KingGrislybeardThen they came to a great city', 'Whose is this noble city said she.It belongs to King Grislybeard hadst thou taken him it had all beenthine', 'Ah wretch that I am sighed she why did I not marry KingGrislybeard That is no business of mine said the fiddler whyshould you wish for another husband Am not I good enough for youAt last they came to a small cottage', 'What a paltry place said sheto whom does that little dirty hole belong Then the fiddler saidThat is your and my house where we are to live', 'Where are yourservants cried she', 'What do we want with servants said he youmust do for yourself whatever is to be done', 'Now make the fire and puton water and cook my supper for I am very tired', 'But the princess knewnothing of making fires and cooking and the fiddler was forced to helpher', 'When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed but thefiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house', 'Thusthey lived for two days and when they had eaten up all there was in thecottage the man said Wife we cant go on thus spending money andearning nothing', 'You must learn to weave baskets', 'Then he went out andcut willows and brought them home and she began to weave but it madeher fingers very sore', 'I see this work wont do said he try andspin perhaps you will do that better', 'So she sat down and tried tospin but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran', 'Seenow said the fiddler you are good for nothing you can do no workwhat a bargain I have got However Ill try and set up a trade in potsand pans and you shall stand in the market and sell them', 'Alassighed she if any of my fathers court should pass by and see mestanding in the market how they will laugh at meBut her husband did not care for that and said she must work if shedid not wish to die of hunger', 'At first the trade went well for manypeople seeing such a beautiful woman went to buy her wares and paidtheir money without thinking of taking away the goods', 'They lived onthis as long as it lasted and then her husband bought a fresh lot ofware and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market buta drunken soldier soon came by and rode his horse against her stalland broke all her goods into a thousand pieces', 'Then she began to cryand knew not what to do', 'Ah what will become of me said she whatwill my husband say So she ran home and told him all', 'Who wouldhave thought you would have been so silly said he as to put anearthenware stall in the corner of the market where everybody passesbut let us have no more crying I see you are not fit for this sort ofwork so I have been to the kings palace and asked if they did notwant a kitchenmaid and they say they will take you and there you willhave plenty to eat.Thus the princess became a kitchenmaid and helped the cook to do allthe dirtiest work but she was allowed to carry home some of the meatthat was left and on this they lived.She had not been there long before she heard that the kings eldest sonwas passing by going to be married and she went to one of the windowsand looked out', 'Everything was ready and all the pomp and brightness ofthe court was there', 'Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and follywhich had brought her so low', 'And the servants gave her some of the richmeats which she put into her basket to take home.All on a sudden as she was going out in came the kings son in goldenclothes and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door he took herby the hand and said she should be his partner in the dance but shetrembled for fear for she saw that it was King Grislybeard who wasmaking sport of her', 'However he kept fast hold and led her in and thecover of the basket came off so that the meats in it fell about', 'Theneverybody laughed and jeered at her and she was so abashed that shewished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth', 'She sprang to thedoor to run away but on the steps King Grislybeard overtook her andbrought her back and said Fear me not I am the fiddler who has livedwith you in the hut', 'I brought you there because I really loved you', 'Iam also the soldier that overset your stall', 'I have done all this onlyto cure you of your silly pride and to show you the folly of yourilltreatment of me', 'Now all is over you have learnt wisdom and it istime to hold our marriage feast.Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes andher father and his whole court were there already and welcomed her homeon her marriage', 'Joy was in every face and every heart', 'The feast wasgrand they danced and sang all were merry and I only wish that youand I had been of the party.IRON HANSThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near hispalace full of all kinds of wild animals', 'One day he sent out ahuntsman to shoot him a roe but he did not come back', 'Perhaps someaccident has befallen him said the king and the next day he sent outtwo more huntsmen who were to search for him but they too stayed away.Then on the third day he sent for all his huntsmen and said Scourthe whole forest through and do not give up until you have found allthree', 'But of these also none came home again none were seen again.From that time forth no one would any longer venture into the forestand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude and nothing was seenof it but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it', 'This lasted formany years when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king asseeking a situation and offered to go into the dangerous forest', 'Theking however would not give his consent and said It is not safe inthere I fear it would fare with you no better than with the othersand you would never come out again', 'The huntsman replied Lord I willventure it at my own risk of fear I know nothing.The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest', 'It wasnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way and wanted topursue it but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before adeep pool could go no farther and a naked arm stretched itself out ofthe water seized it and drew it under', 'When the huntsman saw that hewent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out thewater', 'When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose bodywas brown like rusty iron and whose hair hung over his face down to hisknees', 'They bound him with cords and led him away to the castle', 'Therewas great astonishment over the wild man the king however had him putin an iron cage in his courtyard and forbade the door to be openedon pain of death and the queen herself was to take the key into herkeeping', 'And from this time forth everyone could again go into theforest with safety.The king had a son of eight years who was once playing in thecourtyard and while he was playing his golden ball fell into the cage.The boy ran thither and said Give me my ball out', 'Not till you haveopened the door for me answered the man', 'No said the boy I willnot do that the king has forbidden it and ran away', 'The next day heagain went and asked for his ball the wild man said Open my doorbut the boy would not', 'On the third day the king had ridden out huntingand the boy went once more and said I cannot open the door even if Iwished for I have not the key', 'Then the wild man said It lies underyour mothers pillow you can get it there', 'The boy who wanted to havehis ball back cast all thought to the winds and brought the key', 'Thedoor opened with difficulty and the boy pinched his fingers', 'When itwas open the wild man stepped out gave him the golden ball and hurriedaway', 'The boy had become afraid he called and cried after him Ohwild man do not go away or I shall be beaten The wild man turnedback took him up set him on his shoulder and went with hasty stepsinto the forest', 'When the king came home he observed the empty cageand asked the queen how that had happened', 'She knew nothing about itand sought the key but it was gone', 'She called the boy but no oneanswered', 'The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields butthey did not find him', 'Then he could easily guess what had happened andmuch grief reigned in the royal court.When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest he took the boydown from his shoulder and said to him You will never see your fatherand mother again but I will keep you with me for you have set me freeand I have compassion on you', 'If you do all I bid you you shall farewell', 'Of treasure and gold have I enough and more than anyone in theworld', 'He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept and thenext morning the man took him to a well and said Behold the goldwell is as bright and clear as crystal you shall sit beside it andtake care that nothing falls into it or it will be polluted', 'I willcome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order', 'The boy placedhimself by the brink of the well and often saw a golden fish or agolden snake show itself therein and took care that nothing fell in.As he was thus sitting his finger hurt him so violently that heinvoluntarily put it in the water', 'He drew it quickly out again but sawthat it was quite gilded and whatsoever pains he took to wash the goldoff again all was to no purpose', 'In the evening Iron Hans came backlooked at the boy and said What has happened to the well Nothingnothing he answered and held his finger behind his back that theman might not see it', 'But he said You have dipped your finger intothe water this time it may pass but take care you do not again letanything go in', 'By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well andwatching it', 'His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his headand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well', 'He took it quicklyout but it was already quite gilded', 'Iron Hans came and already knewwhat had happened', 'You have let a hair fall into the well said he.I will allow you to watch by it once more but if this happens for thethird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain withme.On the third day the boy sat by the well and did not stir his fingerhowever much it hurt him', 'But the time was long to him and he looked atthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water', 'And as hestill bent down more and more while he was doing so and trying to lookstraight into the eyes his long hair fell down from his shoulders intothe water', 'He raised himself up quickly but the whole of the hair ofhis head was already golden and shone like the sun', 'You can imagine howterrified the poor boy was He took his pockethandkerchief and tied itround his head in order that the man might not see it', 'When he came healready knew everything and said Take the handkerchief off', 'Then thegolden hair streamed forth and let the boy excuse himself as he mightit was of no use', 'You have not stood the trial and can stay here nolonger', 'Go forth into the world there you will learn what poverty is.But as you have not a bad heart and as I mean well by you there isone thing I will grant you if you fall into any difficulty come to theforest and cry Iron Hans and then I will come and help you', 'Mypower is great greater than you think and I have gold and silver inabundance.Then the kings son left the forest and walked by beaten and unbeatenpaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city', 'There helooked for work but could find none and he learnt nothing by which hecould help himself', 'At length he went to the palace and asked if theywould take him in', 'The people about court did not at all know what usethey could make of him but they liked him and told him to stay', 'Atlength the cook took him into his service and said he might carry woodand water and rake the cinders together', 'Once when it so happened thatno one else was at hand the cook ordered him to carry the food to theroyal table but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen hekept his little cap on', 'Such a thing as that had never yet come underthe kings notice and he said When you come to the royal table youmust take your hat off', 'He answered Ah Lord I cannot I have a badsore place on my head', 'Then the king had the cook called before himand scolded him and asked how he could take such a boy as that into hisservice and that he was to send him away at once', 'The cook howeverhad pity on him and exchanged him for the gardeners boy.And now the boy had to plant and water the garden hoe and dig and bearthe wind and bad weather', 'Once in summer when he was working alone inthe garden the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the airmight cool him', 'As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed sothat the rays fell into the bedroom of the kings daughter and up shesprang to see what that could be', 'Then she saw the boy and cried tohim Boy bring me a wreath of flowers', 'He put his cap on with allhaste and gathered wild fieldflowers and bound them together', 'When hewas ascending the stairs with them the gardener met him and said Howcan you take the kings daughter a garland of such common flowers Goquickly and get another and seek out the prettiest and rarest', 'Ohno replied the boy the wild ones have more scent and will pleaseher better', 'When he got into the room the kings daughter said Takeyour cap off it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence', 'He againsaid I may not I have a sore head', 'She however caught at hiscap and pulled it off and then his golden hair rolled down on hisshoulders and it was splendid to behold', 'He wanted to run out but sheheld him by the arm and gave him a handful of ducats', 'With these hedeparted but he cared nothing for the gold pieces', 'He took them to thegardener and said I present them to your children they can play withthem', 'The following day the kings daughter again called to him that hewas to bring her a wreath of fieldflowers and then he went in with itshe instantly snatched at his cap and wanted to take it away from himbut he held it fast with both hands', 'She again gave him a handful ofducats but he would not keep them and gave them to the gardener forplaythings for his children', 'On the third day things went just thesame she could not get his cap away from him and he would not have hermoney.Not long afterwards the country was overrun by war', 'The king gatheredtogether his people and did not know whether or not he could offer anyopposition to the enemy who was superior in strength and had a mightyarmy', 'Then said the gardeners boy I am grown up and will go to thewars also only give me a horse', 'The others laughed and said Seekone for yourself when we are gone we will leave one behind us in thestable for you', 'When they had gone forth he went into the stable andled the horse out it was lame of one foot and limped hobblety jibhobblety jib nevertheless he mounted it and rode away to the darkforest', 'When he came to the outskirts he called Iron Hans threetimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees', 'Thereupon the wild manappeared immediately and said What do you desire I want a strongsteed for I am going to the wars', 'That you shall have and still morethan you ask for', 'Then the wild man went back into the forest and itwas not long before a stableboy came out of it who led a horse thatsnorted with its nostrils and could hardly be restrained and behindthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron andtheir swords flashed in the sun', 'The youth made over his threeleggedhorse to the stableboy mounted the other and rode at the head of thesoldiers', 'When he got near the battlefield a great part of the kingsmen had already fallen and little was wanting to make the rest giveway', 'Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers broke likea hurricane over the enemy and beat down all who opposed him', 'Theybegan to flee but the youth pursued and never stopped until therewas not a single man left', 'Instead of returning to the king however heconducted his troop by byways back to the forest and called forth IronHans', 'What do you desire asked the wild man', 'Take back your horseand your troops and give me my threelegged horse again', 'All that heasked was done and soon he was riding on his threelegged horse', 'Whenthe king returned to his palace his daughter went to meet him andwished him joy of his victory', 'I am not the one who carried away thevictory said he but a strange knight who came to my assistance withhis soldiers', 'The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight wasbut the king did not know and said He followed the enemy and I didnot see him again', 'She inquired of the gardener where his boy was buthe smiled and said He has just come home on his threelegged horseand the others have been mocking him and crying Here comes ourhobblety jib back again They asked too Under what hedge have youbeen lying sleeping all the time So he said I did the best of alland it would have gone badly without me', 'And then he was still moreridiculed.The king said to his daughter I will proclaim a great feast that shalllast for three days and you shall throw a golden apple', 'Perhaps theunknown man will show himself', 'When the feast was announced the youthwent out to the forest and called Iron Hans', 'What do you desireasked he', 'That I may catch the kings daughters golden apple', 'It isas safe as if you had it already said Iron Hans', 'You shall likewisehave a suit of red armour for the occasion and ride on a spiritedchestnuthorse', 'When the day came the youth galloped to the spot tookhis place amongst the knights and was recognized by no one', 'The kingsdaughter came forward and threw a golden apple to the knights but noneof them caught it but he only as soon as he had it he galloped away.On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight and gave hima white horse', 'Again he was the only one who caught the apple andhe did not linger an instant but galloped off with it', 'The king grewangry and said That is not allowed he must appear before me and tellhis name', 'He gave the order that if the knight who caught the appleshould go away again they should pursue him and if he would not comeback willingly they were to cut him down and stab him.On the third day he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour anda black horse and again he caught the apple', 'But when he was riding offwith it the kings attendants pursued him and one of them got so nearhim that he wounded the youths leg with the point of his sword', 'Theyouth nevertheless escaped from them but his horse leapt so violentlythat the helmet fell from the youths head and they could see that hehad golden hair', 'They rode back and announced this to the king.The following day the kings daughter asked the gardener about hisboy', 'He is at work in the garden the queer creature has been at thefestival too and only came home yesterday evening he has likewiseshown my children three golden apples which he has won.The king had him summoned into his presence and he came and again hadhis little cap on his head', 'But the kings daughter went up to him andtook it off and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders andhe was so handsome that all were amazed', 'Are you the knight who cameevery day to the festival always in different colours and who caughtthe three golden apples asked the king', 'Yes answered he and herethe apples are and he took them out of his pocket and returned themto the king', 'If you desire further proof you may see the wound whichyour people gave me when they followed me', 'But I am likewise the knightwho helped you to your victory over your enemies', 'If you can performsuch deeds as that you are no gardeners boy tell me who is yourfather My father is a mighty king and gold have I in plenty as greatas I require', 'I well see said the king that I owe my thanks toyou can I do anything to please you Yes answered he that indeedyou can', 'Give me your daughter to wife', 'The maiden laughed and saidHe does not stand much on ceremony but I have already seen by hisgolden hair that he was no gardeners boy and then she went andkissed him', 'His father and mother came to the wedding and were in greatdelight for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dearson again', 'And as they were sitting at the marriagefeast the musicsuddenly stopped the doors opened and a stately king came in with agreat retinue', 'He went up to the youth embraced him and said I amIron Hans and was by enchantment a wild man but you have set me freeall the treasures which I possess shall be your property.CATSKINThere was once a king whose queen had hair of the purest gold and wasso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face ofthe earth', 'But this beautiful queen fell ill and when she felt that herend drew near she called the king to her and said Promise me that youwill never marry again unless you meet with a wife who is as beautifulas I am and who has golden hair like mine', 'Then when the king in hisgrief promised all she asked she shut her eyes and died', 'But the kingwas not to be comforted and for a long time never thought of takinganother wife', 'At last however his wise men said this will not dothe king must marry again that we may have a queen', 'So messengers weresent far and wide to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.But there was no princess in the world so beautiful and if there hadbeen still there was not one to be found who had golden hair', 'So themessengers came home and had had all their trouble for nothing.Now the king had a daughter who was just as beautiful as her motherand had the same golden hair', 'And when she was grown up the king lookedat her and saw that she was just like this late queen then he said tohis courtiers May I not marry my daughter She is the very image of mydead wife unless I have her I shall not find any bride upon the wholeearth and you say there must be a queen', 'When the courtiers heard thisthey were shocked and said Heaven forbid that a father should marryhis daughter Out of so great a sin no good can come', 'And his daughterwas also shocked but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughtsso she said to him Before I marry anyone I must have three dressesone must be of gold like the sun another must be of shining silverlike the moon and a third must be dazzling as the stars besides thisI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together towhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin', 'And thusshe thought he would think of the matter no more', 'But the king made themost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses one goldenlike the sun another silvery like the moon and a third sparklinglike the stars and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts inhis kingdom and to take the finest fur out of their skins and thus amantle of a thousand furs was made.When all were ready the king sent them to her but she got up in thenight when all were asleep and took three of her trinkets a goldenring a golden necklace and a golden brooch and packed the threedressesof the sun the moon and the starsup in a nutshell andwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur and besmearedher face and hands with soot', 'Then she threw herself upon Heaven forhelp in her need and went away and journeyed on the whole night tillat last she came to a large wood', 'As she was very tired she sat herselfdown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep and there she slepton till it was midday.Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it his dogscame to the tree and began to snuff about and run round and round andbark', 'Look sharp said the king to the huntsmen and see what sortof game lies there', 'And the huntsmen went up to the tree and when theycame back again said In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderfulbeast such as we never saw before its skin seems to be of a thousandkinds of fur but there it lies fast asleep', 'See said the king ifyou can catch it alive and we will take it with us', 'So the huntsmentook it up and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened and saidI am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left have pity onme and take me with you', 'Then they said Yes Miss Catskin you willdo for the kitchen you can sweep up the ashes and do things of thatsort', 'So they put her into the coach and took her home to the kingspalace', 'Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase whereno light of day ever peeped in and said Catskin you may lie andsleep there', 'And she was sent into the kitchen and made to fetch woodand water to blow the fire pluck the poultry pick the herbs sift theashes and do all the dirty work.Thus Catskin lived for a long time very sorrowfully', 'Ah prettyprincess thought she what will now become of thee But it happenedone day that a feast was to be held in the kings castle so she said tothe cook May I go up a little while and see what is going on I willtake care and stand behind the door', 'And the cook said Yes you maygo but be back again in half an hours time to rake out the ashes.Then she took her little lamp and went into her cabin and took off thefur skin and washed the soot from off her face and hands so that herbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds', 'She next openedher nutshell and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sunand so went to the feast', 'Everyone made way for her for nobody knewher and they thought she could be no less than a kings daughter', 'Butthe king came up to her and held out his hand and danced with her andhe thought in his heart I never saw any one half so beautiful.When the dance was at an end she curtsied and when the king lookedround for her she was gone no one knew wither', 'The guards that stoodat the castle gate were called in but they had seen no one', 'The truthwas that she had run into her little cabin pulled off her dressblackened her face and hands put on the furskin cloak and wasCatskin again', 'When she went into the kitchen to her work and beganto rake the ashes the cook said Let that alone till the morning andheat the kings soup I should like to run up now and give a peep buttake care you dont let a hair fall into it or you will run a chance ofnever eating again.As soon as the cook went away Catskin heated the kings soup andtoasted a slice of bread first as nicely as ever she could and when itwas ready she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ringand put it into the dish in which the soup was', 'When the dance was overthe king ordered his soup to be brought in and it pleased him so wellthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before', 'At the bottomhe saw a gold ring lying and as he could not make out how it had gotthere he ordered the cook to be sent for', 'The cook was frightened whenhe heard the order and said to Catskin You must have let a hair fallinto the soup if it be so you will have a good beating', 'Then he wentbefore the king and he asked him who had cooked the soup', 'I didanswered the cook', 'But the king said That is not true it was betterdone than you could do it', 'Then he answered To tell the truth I didnot cook it but Catskin did', 'Then let Catskin come up said theking and when she came he said to her Who are you I am a poorchild said she that has lost both father and mother', 'How came youin my palace asked he', 'I am good for nothing said she but to besculliongirl and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head', 'But howdid you get the ring that was in the soup asked the king', 'Then shewould not own that she knew anything about the ring so the king senther away again about her business.After a time there was another feast and Catskin asked the cook to lether go up and see it as before', 'Yes said he but come again in halfan hour and cook the king the soup that he likes so much', 'Then sheran to her little cabin washed herself quickly and took her dressout which was silvery as the moon and put it on and when she went inlooking like a kings daughter the king went up to her and rejoiced atseeing her again and when the dance began he danced with her', 'After thedance was at an end she managed to slip out so slyly that the king didnot see where she was gone but she sprang into her little cabin andmade herself into Catskin again and went into the kitchen to cook thesoup', 'Whilst the cook was above stairs she got the golden necklace anddropped it into the soup then it was brought to the king who ate itand it pleased him as well as before so he sent for the cook whowas again forced to tell him that Catskin had cooked it', 'Catskin wasbrought again before the king but she still told him that she was onlyfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the thirdtime it happened just the same as before', 'You must be a witchCatskin said the cook for you always put something into your soupso that it pleases the king better than mine', 'However he let her go upas before', 'Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars andwent into the ballroom in it and the king danced with her again andthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then', 'So whilsthe was dancing with her he put a gold ring on her finger without herseeing it and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.When it was at an end he would have held her fast by the hand but sheslipped away and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sightof her and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin underthe stairs', 'But this time she kept away too long and stayed beyond thehalfhour so she had not time to take off her fine dress and threw herfur mantle over it and in her haste did not blacken herself all overwith soot but left one of her fingers white.Then she ran into the kitchen and cooked the kings soup and as soonas the cook was gone she put the golden brooch into the dish', 'When theking got to the bottom he ordered Catskin to be called once more andsoon saw the white finger and the ring that he had put on it whilstthey were dancing so he seized her hand and kept fast hold of it andwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away the fur cloak fell offa little on one side and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off and her golden hair andbeautiful form were seen and she could no longer hide herself so shewashed the soot and ashes from her face and showed herself to be themost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth', 'But the king saidYou are my beloved bride and we will never more be parted from eachother', 'And the wedding feast was held and a merry day it was as everwas heard of or seen in that country or indeed in any other.SNOWWHITE AND ROSEREDThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage', 'In front ofthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rosetrees one of which borewhite and the other red roses', 'She had two children who were like thetwo rosetrees and one was called Snowwhite and the other Rosered.They were as good and happy as busy and cheerful as ever two childrenin the world were only Snowwhite was more quiet and gentle thanRosered', 'Rosered liked better to run about in the meadows and fieldsseeking flowers and catching butterflies but Snowwhite sat at homewith her mother and helped her with her housework or read to her whenthere was nothing to do.The two children were so fond of one another that they always held eachother by the hand when they went out together and when Snowwhite saidWe will not leave each other Rosered answered Never so long as welive and their mother would add What one has she must share with theother.They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries and nobeasts did them any harm but came close to them trustfully', 'The littlehare would eat a cabbageleaf out of their hands the roe grazed bytheir side the stag leapt merrily by them and the birds sat still uponthe boughs and sang whatever they knew.No mishap overtook them if they had stayed too late in the forest andnight came on they laid themselves down near one another upon the mossand slept until morning came and their mother knew this and did notworry on their account.Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had rousedthem they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting neartheir bed', 'He got up and looked quite kindly at them but said nothingand went into the forest', 'And when they looked round they found thatthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice and would certainlyhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few pacesfurther', 'And their mother told them that it must have been the angel whowatches over good children.Snowwhite and Rosered kept their mothers little cottage so neat thatit was a pleasure to look inside it', 'In the summer Rosered took careof the house and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mothersbed before she awoke in which was a rose from each tree', 'In the winterSnowwhite lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob', 'The kettlewas of brass and shone like gold so brightly was it polished', 'In theevening when the snowflakes fell the mother said Go Snowwhite andbolt the door and then they sat round the hearth and the mother tookher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book and the two girlslistened as they sat and spun', 'And close by them lay a lamb upon thefloor and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its headhidden beneath its wings.One evening as they were thus sitting comfortably together someoneknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in', 'The mother saidQuick Rosered open the door it must be a traveller who is seekingshelter', 'Rosered went and pushed back the bolt thinking that it was apoor man but it was not it was a bear that stretched his broad blackhead within the door.Rosered screamed and sprang back the lamb bleated the dove flutteredand Snowwhite hid herself behind her mothers bed', 'But the bear beganto speak and said Do not be afraid I will do you no harm I amhalffrozen and only want to warm myself a little beside you.Poor bear said the mother lie down by the fire only take care thatyou do not burn your coat', 'Then she cried Snowwhite Rosered comeout the bear will do you no harm he means well', 'So they both cameout and byandby the lamb and dove came nearer and were not afraidof him', 'The bear said Here children knock the snow out of my coat alittle so they brought the broom and swept the bears hide cleanan']\n"
